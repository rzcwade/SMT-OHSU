{\an8}《衰女翻身》
第一季  第二集

5
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,400
我是普多  请留言
Hi, it's Poodle, leave a message.

6
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,970
普多
Oh, hey, Poodle.

7
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,520
又是我  米琪
Hey, it's me, Mickey, again.

8
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,430
记得我吧
Uh, remember me? 

9
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,540
你把你家孩子们硬塞给我
The one you saddled with your kids,

10
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,010
让我照看那群熊孩子
who are awful, by the way.

11
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,630
我就是...  我就是觉得
Listen, I was just-- I had this thought that

12
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,140
你要是能抽出一点点时间
maybe if you had a couple spare minutes,

13
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,480
给他们打个电话吧
you could give 'em a call

14
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,110
让他们知道你逃出境了
and let them know that you fled the country

15
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,470
把他们丢给了一个陌生人
and left them with a total stranger,

16
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,730
你个自私的贱人婊
you stupid, selfish monsters!

17
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,810
总之  给我回电
Anyway, give me a call.

18
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,750
好
Okay.

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,070
你能行
You got this.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,880
接到了
Touchdown!

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,680
该她了  给她一只虾
Her turn, hit her with a shrimp!

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,020
不用了  谢了
No, no, thank you.

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,560
我可不想得肝炎
I'm not trying to get hepatitis.

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,030
我想得肝炎
I want hepatitis.

25
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,390
这就来  小家伙
Coming your way, buddy!

26
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,990
这很棒吧  各位
This is awesome, right, guys?

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,810
我们为什么来穷人的地方吃饭
Why are we in a poor person's restaurant?

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,400
你哪根筋不对啊
What's the matter with you?

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,490
这不是穷人来的地方  别这么欠抽
It's not a poor person's restaurant-- don't be an ass.

30
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,980
这人都不是日本人  他叫佩德罗
This guy's not even Japanese. His name's Pedro.

31
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,920
好吧  汉密尔顿不是波多黎各
All right, well, Hamilton wasn't Puerto Rican,

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,050
但人们觉得还不错呢
but people seem to be enjoying that just fine.

33
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,810
好了  我带你们过来是因为
All right, listen, I brought you guys here because I,

34
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,700
我要跟你说个重要的消息  不是...
I got to tell you some pretty big news, and it's not...

35
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,370
-不想听  -不想听  你...
- Pass. - Pass? What are...?

36
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,380
你要戴上耳机吗  你不是吧
You gonna pop those in right now? Are you kidding me?

37
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,490
算了  本  奇普  听着
Fine. Forget you. Ben, Chip, listen.

38
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,770
-这很不容易...  -本
- This is going to be pretty hard to... - Hey, Ben,

39
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,910
你敢不敢舔烤板
I dare you to lick the grill.

40
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,600
什么  闭嘴  听我说
What? Shut up! Just listen to me.

41
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,690
什么味道呀
What's it taste like?

42
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,710
可美味了
Oh, it's delicious! 

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,000
来吧  我给你一千块
Come on, I'll give you a thousand bucks.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,420
别舔  他没有一千块
No, don't. He does not have a thousand dollars.

45
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,300
-傻眼了吧  -天呐  你真欠收拾
- Boom. - Oh, my God. You are a nightmare.

46
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,640
本  别这么做  懂了吗
Ben, don't do it, okay?

47
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,470
你能听我说吗
Will you just please listen? 

48
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,650
塞布丽娜  这是要事
Sabrina, this is serious.

49
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,330
别碰我东西  变态
Don't touch my stuff, psycho.

50
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,340
我就是想告诉你们
I just thought you might like to know 

51
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,490
你们的父母离开了  不回来了
that your parents are gone and they're not coming back.

52
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,490
他们死了吗
They're dead?

53
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,870
不  没死
No, no. Not dead.

54
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,450
他们活得好好的
They're definitely not dead.

55
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,490
但他们逃出国了
But they did flee the country.

56
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,330
这没道理啊  他们又没做错什么
That doesn't make any sense. They didn't do anything wrong.

57
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,030
这可说不好
Uh, I don't, I don't, I don't know.

58
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,090
这我可不敢说
I'm not going to touch that one.

59
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,890
我不信  你说谎
No, I don't believe you. You're lying.

60
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,970
我为什么要说谎呢
Why would I lie about that?

61
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,060
还能是什么  因为你是个说谎精呗
Um, I don't know, maybe because you're a lying bitch.

62
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,840
听着  我理解你们很难接受
Okay, look, I understand this is really hard stuff to hear.

63
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,730
这不难接受
It's not hard to hear.

64
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,920
其实很容易接受
It's actually really easy.

65
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,700
因为我根本不在乎
I, like, literally don't care at all.

66
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,240
好吧  但你突然提高音量
Okay, well the pitch of your voice 

67
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,500
-感觉你很在乎啊  -我不在乎
- is making it seem like you care a lot. - I don't care!

68
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,600
只是觉得很丢脸而已
It's just-- it's embarrassing, that's all.

69
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,700
是  没错  同意  确实很丢脸
Yes, it is, it is, agreed. It's very embarrassing.

70
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,330
我们小点声说吧
Let's just keep our voices down, okay?

71
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,840
这些男士们还想好好吃饭呢
These gentlemen are trying to enjoy their dinner.

72
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,700
你觉得我在意这些蠢货吗
You think I care about these idiots?

73
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,370
抱歉
Sorry.

74
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,310
你怎么回事  你闹哪一出啊
What is wrong with you? You're making a scene.

75
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,930
懂了  很抱歉
Oh, oh. I'm so, I'm so sorry.

76
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,470
让我纠正一下
Let me make it right.

77
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,550
这样够出戏了吗
How is that for a scene?

78
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,990
-怎么...  -吃饭还能看戏
- What... - Dinner and a show! 

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,980
赶紧吃吧  畜生们
Lap it up, you dogs!

80
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,280
马上给我回来
Hey, get-get back over here right now!

81
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,240
别命令我  你又不是我妈
Oh, don't tell us what to do! You're not our mom.

82
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,400
-你只是想找她救济你  -塞布丽娜
- You're just looking for a handout. - Hey, Sabrina...

83
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,160
发型脏乱差  衣服破到家
You with your bad hair and your Dumpster clothes!

84
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,420
我知道你打什么算盘
I know what you're up to, 

85
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,450
我来告诉你
and I'll tell you something,

86
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,060
你不会得逞的
you're not going to get away with that.

87
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,650
希望你觉得很光彩
Well, I hope you're very proud of yourself.

88
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,860
你弟弟的味蕾全被烫坏了
Your brother has burned off all of his taste buds.

89
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,460
我为自己的行为道歉
I'd like to apologize for my behavior.

90
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,500
我明白  作为家里的新当家
I understand, as the new patriarch of this family,

91
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,940
你们都指望我做好榜样
you are all looking to me to set the tone,

92
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,260
我让大家失望了
and I fell short. 

93
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,150
别瞎掰呼了
Stop it, okay?

94
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,520
没人指望你
Nobody's looking to you for anything.

95
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,290
不好意思  你觉得你说得算吗
Oh, I'm sorry. You think you're in charge?

96
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,150
我们不会听你的
We're not gonna listen to a single word you say.

97
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,420
你们也不用啊
Well, you're not gonna have to. 

98
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,620
因为我很快就离开这个鬼地方了
'Cause I'm catching the last chopper out of Saigon.

99
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,270
你要走了吗
You're leaving?

100
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,820
对  艾尔巴  我要走了
Yeah, Alba, I'm leaving.

101
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,290
你没看外面停的那辆车吗
Have you seen that car outside? 

102
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,090
也许是联调局的条子呢
That's a pig. Probably FBI.

103
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,510
我想国税局的人也快来了
And I'm pretty sure the IRS is not far behind.

104
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,230
等这些全被没收了  艾尔巴
And once all this is gone, Alba, 

105
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,030
就只剩下这些熊孩子了
all that's left is this.

106
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,400
没钱  谁肯照顾这些小魔头
And nobody wants just this.

107
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,390
你要去哪里
Well, where you gonna go?

108
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,020
我要回罗得岛
I'm gonna go back to Rhode Island.

109
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,240
我在那里没有责任  自由自在
Where I have no responsibilities and nobody to answer to.

110
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,280
没工作的单身狗咯
So, unemployed and alone?

111
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,240
听起来不错
Sounds neat.

112
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,040
我要是能揍你就好了
I wish I could bash you.

113
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,750
谢谢你了  麦肯齐
Okay, thank you for your time, Mackenzie,

114
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,800
接下来这个家就交给我了
but I think I've got it from here.

115
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,920
太好了  你肯定想  奇普
Oh, wonderful. I bet you do, Chip. Great. 

116
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,700
但为防出事  我联系了你的爷爷奶奶
But just in case, I've called your dad's parents,

117
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,680
他们马上就过来了
and they're on their way.

118
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,850
「上校」吗  太棒了  他就是个传奇啊
The Colonel? No way. That guy's a legend.

119
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,760
我的职业规划就是追随他的脚步
I've modeled my entire career after him.

120
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,410
没错  我也喜欢「上校」
O-Oh, yes. I-I like the Colonel very much.

121
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,360
我小时候
When I was a little girl, 

122
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,310
他来到我在危地马拉的村子
he came to my village in Guatemala

123
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,440
建造了医院
and built the hospital.

124
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,970
他把我和我妈带回了美国
And then he brought me and my mother back to the States.

125
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,260
他会叫我「小蜻蜓」
He would call me his libelula---

126
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,540
蜻蜓
Dragonfly.

127
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,120
然后你就一入「豪门」深似海了吗
And you've been trapped here ever since?

128
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,530
你太嫩了
You're like a veal.

129
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,740
你该多出去转转
Got to get out more. 

130
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,550
等下  他和提比奶奶  岁数过百了吧
Wait, aren't he and Grandma Tippy, like, 100 years old?

131
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,390
电话中听起来像千年老妖
They sounded about 1,000 on the phone, 

132
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,310
所以我得赶紧离开
so I'm gonna get out of here 

133
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,050
省得到时候还得跟他们聊一下
before I get stuck talking about soup or whatever.

134
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,020
行  走吧  我又不在乎
Fine, go. You think I care?

135
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,630
你为什么拿走我们的东西
Why are you taking our stuff?

136
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,770
我照看你们的酬劳呗
Call it payment for services rendered.

137
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,340
你住进豪宅三天  就混走一辆跑车吗
You get that for living in our mansion for three days?

138
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,980
我其实看好了那辆奔驰越野
Well, I was eyeing the G-wagon 

139
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,610
但那车估计一直要加油
but I didn't want to be gassing up the whole time,

140
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,410
所以我就选了这辆
so I decided to go solar.

141
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,280
-这是电动车  -很棒吧
- It's electric. - I know, right?

142
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,340
等下等下  我跟你一起走
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm coming with you.

143
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,900
什么  不行
What? No, you're not.

144
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,020
我们不是朋友吗
W... We are friends, yes?

145
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,030
是啊  我们处得不错
Well, I mean, yeah. We're friendly.

146
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,420
但我...  我已经放了地毯了
But I... You know, I-I already got the rug and...

147
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,870
另外孩子们需要你
Plus, the kids need you.

148
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,730
-不需要  -带走吧
- No, we don't. - Take her.

149
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,120
米琪小姐  我砸那个男人的脑袋时
Miss Mickey, when I smashed that man over the head,

150
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,360
我感觉内心的「小猛兽」被唤醒了
I felt an animal in my chest wake up and roar.

151
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,890
我想让「小猛兽」醒得再猛烈一些
I would very much like to feel that again.

152
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,250
好吧  你这么说  我还怎么拒绝
Okay. I mean, how am I supposed to argue with that?

153
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,660
行  来跟我住几天吧
Fine, come along for a couple days, 

154
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,960
但你得长点心眼  知道吧
but you got to keep up, all right?

155
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,120
我可不想一直照看你
I don't feel like babysitting.

156
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,960
不然就跟这群熊孩子待在一起了
Otherwise I'd stay with these animals.

157
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,070
但这都取决于你  小本本
but I-it's up to you, Benito.

158
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,970
你同意  我才会走
I will only go if I have your blessing.

159
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,100
好
Okay.

160
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,160
好吧  走吧
Okay, let's go.

161
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,020
这就差不多了  祝你们好运
Well, that about does it. Good luck to you.

162
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,790
保重吧
Uh, take care of yourselves.

163
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,280
如果你们有什么需要
And if you need anything at all,

164
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,450
就报警  千万别犹豫
do not hesitate to call 911.

165
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,860
坐稳了
Hold onto your nips,

166
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,470
这车老快了
this kitty can purr.

167
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,800
怎么样啊  「条纸」
What's shakin', bacon?

168
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,160
你说什么[原谅我]
Excuse me?

169
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,020
我原谅你了[失陪了]
You're excused.

170
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,650
能快点吗  「上校」等着我们呢
A little hustle, please. The Colonel's waiting. 

171
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,870
-那又怎样  -拿出些尊重来
- So what? - So show some respect.

172
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,980
他可是战争英雄
He's a freaking war hero.

173
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,120
去过韩国  打过仗
Dude went buck wild on Korea.

174
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,750
瞧瞧这壮汉
Look at this beast.

175
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,920
如果这个家要找当家的男子汉
If there was ever a guy to surrender the patriarch role to,

176
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,220
非他莫属
it's this stud.

177
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,340
怎么回事
What?

178
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,890
你们好
Hello!

179
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,730
天呐
Oh, my Goodness,

180
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,750
你们都长大了啊
Look how big you've all gotten!

181
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,630
塞布丽娜
Sabrina.

182
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,540
亭亭玉立啊
My beautiful angel.

183
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,470
奇普  翩翩君子啊
And Chip, such a dashing young gentleman.

184
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,080
你让我想起了我丈夫
You remind me of my husband.

185
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,620
还有本  小可怜
Oh, and Ben, my poor baby.

186
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,090
我听说你出了小意外
I heard about that little accident you had.

187
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,340
你好  奶奶
Hello, Grandma.

188
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,010
路途太折腾了
Now, it has been a long day,

189
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,340
不如大家都上楼
so why don't we all go upstairs

190
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,940
换上睡衣吧
and change into our PJs?

191
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,500
抱歉  奶奶  我不会待在家
Yeah, sorry, Grandma, that's not gonna work for me.

192
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,900
我今晚要参加派对
I've got a party to go to tonight. 

193
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,380
我很晚才能回来
And I probably won't get home until late,

194
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,550
你就别等我了
so, you know what, don't wait up for me.

195
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,580
你们...
You guys...

196
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,860
我知道你们这几个孩子欠缺管教
I realize you children aren't used to having rules,

197
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,230
但现在我要定规矩了
but all that's going to change. 

198
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,900
现在乖乖听奶奶话  上楼换睡衣
Now, be a good girl and do as Grandma says.

199
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,450
不要
No.

200
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,370
你应该会发现我很讨厌别人顶嘴
I think you'll find I have very little tolerance for back sass, dear.

201
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,730
上楼
Upstairs.

202
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,730
当然  我告诉他只是疹子
So, of course, I'm trying to convince him it was just a rash,

203
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,600
但他不信
but, you know, he wasn't buying it.

204
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,600
我小时候
You know, when I was a little girl, 

205
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,020
一种传染疹子肆虐了我们村子
a rash spread through our village

206
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,890
差点杀死了全村妇女
and nearly took all of the women.

207
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,450
-好极了  -嗯
- Right on. - Yeah.

208
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,730
我们俩都有疹子的故事可聊了
Very cool that we both have rash stories.

209
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,900
这就是我家啦
So, this is it. Home, sweet home.

210
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,500
对  我家离机场很近
Oh, yeah, I live real close to the airport.

211
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,370
特别方便  你渴了吗
Super convenient. Thirsty?

212
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,390
嗯
Yeah.

213
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,460
干杯
Cheers.

214
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,980
来吧  干杯
There we go. Cheers.

215
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,210
杰米
Jimmy?!

216
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,590
我滴娘咧  你还活着
Holy crap, you're alive.

217
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,830
你看起来不错
Oh, you look good.

218
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,290
-什么  别碰我  -你看起来真好
- What? No. Get-Get off of me! - You look really good.

219
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,790
-你干什么  -我很高兴见到你
- What are you doing? - Oh, I'm happy to see you.

220
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,040
我是杰米
I'm Jimmy.

221
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,400
-我是她男友  -他不是我男友
- I'm the boyfriend. - He's not my boyfriend.

222
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,970
我们已经在一起睡了十年了...
Oh, come on. We've been plowing for, like, ten years...

223
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,130
你怎么在我家  杰米
What are you doing here, Jimmy?

224
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,730
你住在我家吗
Are you living in my place?

225
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,150
不  就是管道...
No. The... the pipe is just, like...

226
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,620
-管道吗  -是...
- Oh, the pipe? - Yeah, and it...

227
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,150
滴水了
there's a, there's a... you got a drippy...

228
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,450
管道漏水吗
I got a drippy?

229
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,800
我想念这里的味道
I missed the smells.

230
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,120
我要赶你走
Okay, well, you can smell my ass

231
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,200
你闻个屁吧  赶紧走
when you kiss it good-bye. Leave.

232
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,770
我感觉你对我有点敌意
Okay, you know what, I'm sensing some major hostility here,

233
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,340
我不计较  但这是因为撞车那事吗
which is fine, but is it about the car thing?

234
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,070
你是说你开车撞了我吗
The car thing where you ran me over?

235
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,300
-是  -没错
- Yeah. - Yes, it is.

236
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,570
但我跟你道歉了
Okay. Well, I said I was sorry.

237
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,720
没  你没道歉
No, you didn't say you were sorry.

238
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,060
我现在道歉
I'm saying it now.

239
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,290
杰米  你都没停下看我受没受伤
Jimmy, you didn't even stop.

240
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,840
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead!

241
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,920
你停下了吗
Did you stop?

242
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,260
你停下  想过我的感受了吗
Did you stop and think about how it made me feel?

243
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,330
滚出去
Get out!

244
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,360
-我说真的  滚  -走就走
- I'm serious. Get out. - Oh, fine!

245
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,090
我也不需要
Well, guess what. I don't need this,

246
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,050
我不需要你  也不需要这条浴衣
and I don't need you and I don't need this robe.

247
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,620
拿走浴衣吧  我可不要这浴衣
Come on. Keep the robe. I don't want the robe.

248
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,760
不  我不想要
No, I don't want it.

249
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,260
这会让我想起你  我不想这样
It makes me think of you, and I hate it.

250
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,860
等一下
Wha... Hold on.

251
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,370
你纹了新纹身吗
Did you get a new tattoo?

252
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,950
没错
Yeah, I did.

253
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,540
我后悔了
I regret it.

254
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,000
我提点你一下
And a word to the wise:

255
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,980
那个印度赌场的高利贷
that loan shark from the Indian casino,

256
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,150
他一直在附近打听你  等他来...
he's been poking around, so when he comes to get...

257
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,480
他让我想起了我表哥  维克多
He reminds me of my cousin, Victor.

258
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,280
他母亲怀了他14个月
In the womb for 14 months.

259
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,400
大头症  真惨
Big head. Very sad. 

260
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,480
别在意他  他根本不重要
Yeah. Don't pay attention to him. He's no one.

261
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,390
你想出去
Hey, you want to get out of here,

262
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,190
感受一下镇上的风采吗
go crank the lights up on this town?

263
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,960
我不知道你说什么
I don't know what you say.

264
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,710
没关系  吃掉这个
That's okay. Uh, just take this,

265
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,450
我稍后再跟你解释
and I will explain the rest later.

266
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,200
不  不用了
No. No, thank you.

267
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,930
别担心  药性很弱
Oh, don't worry-- it's super mild.

268
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,930
不用了  我胃口不好  吃不了这个
Oh, no, no, I-I can't, 'cause I have a sensitive stomach.

269
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,250
-我也是  吃一半吧  -不  这东西不好
- Me, too. Just take half. - No, it's-it's no good.

270
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,480
就放在舌头上  告诉我味道如何
Just put it on your tongue and tell me what it tastes like.

271
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
我不能吃  这东西不好
I can't do it! It's not good. 

272
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,090
艾尔巴  朋友之间应互相信任
Alba, friends trust each other. 

273
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,980
不行  我说了不吃
Plea... I said no!

274
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,000
如果你不吃  我就解雇你
I'll fire you if you don't.

275
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,140
我开玩笑呢
I'm just kidding!

276
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,590
抱歉  瞧我把你吓的
Oh, I'm so sorry. Your face. I scared you.

277
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,600
我不能解雇你  你都不是我家佣人
I can't fire you-- you're not even mine.

278
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,150
-你不用吃  -谢谢你
- You don't have to take it. - Oh, thank you.

279
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,520
因为你已经吃了
'Cause you already took it.

280
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,010
等下  什么
Wait, what?

281
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,460
我之前在酒里放了一片
I popped one in your beer earlier.

282
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,840
你开玩笑吧  肯定是玩笑吧
No, y-you're joking. This is a joke, right?

283
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,660
我当然是开玩笑了
Of course I'm joking!

284
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,240
谁会那么做啊
Who would do that?

285
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,310
-我看不出来你是不是开玩笑  -我知道
- I can't tell, I can't tell. - I know.

286
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,920
其实我开玩笑说是开玩笑
Actually, I'm joking about joking.

287
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,640
你已经吃下有十分钟了
I'd say you have about ten minutes.

288
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,550
什么  不不不
Wha...? Oh. Oh, no, no.

289
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,050
我要去梳洗打扮一下了
Yeah. You know what, I'm gonna go freshen up.

290
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,220
-这会很有意思的  -别走啊
- This is gonna be fun. - Don't leave. No.

291
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,990
你干什么
What are you doing?

292
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,220
我要去做个烤奶酪
I was gonna go make a grilled cheese.

293
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,760
-你干什么  -我要出去
- What are you doing? - I'm going out.

294
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,800
如果奶奶醒了怎么办
What if Grandma wakes up?

295
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,260
那你就告诉她...
Well, you can tell her to eat a big fat...

296
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,050
你们俩要去哪儿呢
And where might you two be going?

297
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,620
我就是想去做个烤奶酪
I was just going to make a grilled cheese.

298
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,890
不  是我想去做烤奶酪
No, I-I was gonna go make a grilled cheese.

299
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,400
真巧啊
What a coincidence-- 

300
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,510
大家晚上都想吃烤奶酪
everyone's got a midnight hankering for some grilled cheese.

301
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,070
好吧  我要出去  我朋友富士今晚打碟
Okay, fine, I'm going out. My friend Fuji is deejaying.

302
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,570
真有趣  你听到了吗  「上校」
Oh, how fun. Did you hear that, Colonel?

303
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,250
富士今晚打碟
Fuji is deejaying. 

304
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,660
不是什么大事  我就是过去跳个舞
Look, it's not that big of a deal-- I'm just going dancing.

305
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,180
怎么不早说  你可以在这里跳啊
Well, why didn't you say so? You can dance right here.

306
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,390
什么
What?

307
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,660
你听到了  跳吧
You heard me. Dance.

308
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,890
-别这样  奶奶  这太扯了  -赶紧跳
- Come on, Grandma, this is insane. - Dance!

309
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,930
你们两位绅士不能让女生独舞吧
You gentlemen aren't going to let a lady dance alone, are you?

310
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,250
来吧
Go on.

311
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,110
跟她一起跳
Join her.

312
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,510
这样好多了
That's better.

313
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,240
这样才好玩嘛
Now we're having fun.

314
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,970
你感觉怎么样啊
How you doing over there?

315
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,930
-我还好吧  -是吗
- I... Good, I think. - Yeah?

316
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,840
我迈不动腿  但...
My legs are heavy, but...

317
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,580
精神上似神仙
my mind is light.

318
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,890
而我的背部汗流成河
And my back is slick with a river of sweat.

319
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,840
我感觉很放松
I feel relaxed but...

320
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,430
但精神又很集中
also focused.

321
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,950
有点暖和
Kind of warm, too.

322
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,500
总体上很好  我感觉很棒啊
Overall, good. I feel good!

323
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,310
这就好  你说了很多啊
Great. That was a lot of info there.

324
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,050
-谢谢了  -嗯
- Thank you so much. - Yeah.

325
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,600
这酒就别一饮而尽了
That's not what you want to gulp.

326
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,170
别一饮而尽
No... no guzzling.

327
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,760
好吧  你自己要喝的
All right, that's on you.

328
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,850
你想跳舞吗
Do you want to go dance?

329
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,350
来吧  老娘要出场了
Yeah, lead the way, bitch!

330
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,180
我们要死了
We're gonna die!

331
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,380
-什么  -好了  好了  到家了
- What? What? - Okay, okay, we're home.

332
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,220
我们到家了  好极了
We're home. Right on.

333
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,100
我头好疼啊
Oh, my mind is in pain.

334
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,980
艾尔巴  天呐  你那么大声干什么
Oh, Alba, God, do you have to scream?

335
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,670
震得我头都炸了
It's like nails in a blender.

336
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,800
我们回家  睡一觉吧
Let's just get inside and pass out, and then...

337
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,440
我家窗户怎么开着
Wait, why is my window open?

338
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,770
杰米是不是提过那个高利贷的事
Didn't Jimmy mention something about a loan shark?

339
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,770
等一下  我打个电话
Hold on a second. I got to make a phone call.

340
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,180
-你说的话  都听不懂  -别出声...
- Oh, the words you say mean n-nothing. - Just shu...

341
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,680
被你打败了
You're killing me.

342
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,860
杰米
Oh, hey, Jimmy, hey. 

343
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,470
我家靓哥怎么样啊
How's my big, sexy side of beef, huh?

344
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,330
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

345
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,290
上大号呢
Just dumping out. 

346
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,180
我早上吃了些隔夜的蛤蜊...
I ate some leftover clams for breakfast--

347
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,780
结果就开始闹肚子了
they're wreaking havoc on my insides.

348
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,080
你怎么样啊
What's up with you?

349
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,030
没什么啊
Nothing.

350
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,610
我就是想让你过来
I just was hoping that you could come over here

351
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,310
「闹一下」我的肚子呀
and... wreak havoc on my insides.

352
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,330
你很想要吧
You do, do you?

353
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,070
欲火焚身呢
Yeah. Big-time.

354
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,210
快过来  征服我吧
Get over here. Take me.

355
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,170
你自找的啊
You asked for it.

356
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,200
-我拉得到处都是  清理完就过...  -真是够了
- I'm gonna mop up, and I'll be right ov... - I mean...

357
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,980
奶奶说要下来吃早...
Grandma says come down for break...

358
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,740
你干什么
What are you doing?

359
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,060
我要让这个女人尝尝我的厉害
This woman needs to know who she's messing with.

360
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,730
-你确定这样做好吗  -这就像过招
- You sure that's a good idea? - Oh, it's all part of the dance.

361
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,710
她出过招了  现在换我了
She came at me, now I'll come at her,

362
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,270
两人交手  斗智斗勇  其乐无穷
and round and round we'll go in this cruel little game of wits.

363
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,640
-听起来你不正常  -是吗
- You sound insane. - Do I?!

364
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,710
我从米琪那里学来的
I learned it from Mickey.

365
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,290
至少她肯跟我公平过招
At least she appreciated a healthy rivalry.

366
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,980
走吧
Come on.

367
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,590
那是「上校」的培根
That's the Colonel's bacon!

368
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,050
你想吃  就好好表现
You can have bacon when you earn bacon.

369
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,690
你们这群孩子真是被宠坏了
You children have been spoiled rotten.

370
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,040
说真的
I mean, for Goodness' sake,

371
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,520
你们之中就本有点家教
Ben is the only one of you with any manners.

372
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,410
当然这不能全怪你们
Now, I suppose it's not entirely your fault.

373
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,360
这都怪我那蠢儿子和你们那个风骚的妈
I blame my idiot son and that whore mother of yours.

374
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,760
但我要重振家风
But I will restore dignity to our family

375
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,990
直到死为止
if it's the last thing I do.

376
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,010
奇普  从现在开始
Chip, from now on,

377
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,820
你就是「上校」的学徒了
you'll be the Colonel's apprentice.

378
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,650
先从将食物切成小块喂他吃开始吧
You can start by cutting his food into little pieces and feeding him.

379
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,090
没有看护喂他吗
Doesn't he have a nurse for that?

380
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,660
有啊  就是你
He does. You.

381
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,380
而你这个「小公举」
And, uh, little Miss Rosemary Kennedy here

382
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,230
就要学习做个淑女
will learn to behave like a lady,

383
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,460
不然就吃不了兜着走
or she will suffer the consequences.

384
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,150
遵命  奶奶  都听你的
Yes, Grandma. Whatever you say.

385
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,160
很好
Good.

386
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,100
如果没什么事了
Now, if you don't mind, 

387
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,590
我要好好享用咖啡了
I'd like to enjoy my coffee.

388
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,570
干什么啊
What? What?

389
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,800
这下衣服不能穿了  你个老妖婆
You ruined my blouse, you wrinkly bitch!

390
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,160
你穿不了是因你长胖了
Your blouse was ruined by your inability to fill it out.

391
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,650
赶紧去再煮一壶
Now, go put on a fresh pot.

392
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,820
我们来吧
Let's do this.

393
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,590
我到了
Oh, yeah, here we go.

394
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,990
太棒了
Oh, yeah.

395
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,410
等下  等下
Wait, wait.

396
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,810
我的天呐
My Goodness.

397
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,040
米琪
Mickey?

398
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,040
米琪  -该走了
Mickey. - Time to boogie. 

399
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,000
快走啊
Do something!

400
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,140
别担心  我搞得定
Don't worry, I got this.

401
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,720
吸姐的尾气吧  混蛋
Suck solar, bitch.

402
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,620
怎么回事
What-What's happening?

403
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,810
不不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

404
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,140
四千二  米琪
$4,200, Mick.

405
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,360
钱在哪儿
Where is it?

406
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,310
你觉得在哪儿呢
Where do you think it is?

407
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,770
你觉得我像是闹着玩吗
Do I look like I'm playing games? 

408
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,560
好吧  我没钱
Okay. I don't have it.

409
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,530
不如你把那辆车拿走
But what do you say you take that car out front

410
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,380
我们就两清了
and we call it even, huh?

411
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,690
我可不要你偷来的车
I don't want your stolen car.

412
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,010
我不是高利贷  不是偷车贼
I'm a loan shark, not a car thief.

413
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,240
你俩都给我坐下
Sit. Both of you.

414
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,780
米琪  我很害怕  你生活太悲惨了
Mickey, I am scared. Your life is very sad.

415
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,470
我知道  人艰不拆好不好
Yes, I know that, okay? Thank you.

416
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,990
我想回格林威治的家
I want to go home to Greenwich.

417
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,740
太晚了  我们都立完牌坊了
It's too late. We've burned that bridge.

418
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,560
你自己立完了
You burned that bridge.

419
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,670
我们俩都立了
We both burned that bridge.

420
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,100
谁先开始的并不重要
It doesn't matter who lit the match.

421
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,210
我们必须求他们原谅
We must beg their forgiveness. 

422
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,870
奇普少爷会给你钱还债的
Mr. Chip will give you the money to pay for this mess.

423
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,380
我才不要跟一个12岁的小屁孩借钱
I am not borrowing money from a 12-year-old.

424
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,590
说实话  米琪
Honestly, Mickey,

425
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,620
我真替你悲哀啊
I'm depressed for you.

426
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,280
你真是穷得叮当响啊
You literally have nothing.

427
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,680
我都跟你说了
Yeah, that's what I said.

428
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,370
我也不想这么做  但你逼我的
Well, I hate to do it, but you leave me no choice.

429
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,340
把你的手放在桌上吧
Put your hand flat on the table.

430
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,040
好吧  我知道你得走个过场吓唬我
Okay, look, I know you got to do the whole tough guy routine,

431
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,550
但我们都知道
but, listen, you and I, we all know

432
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,500
你绝不会对一个女人下手
that you're not actually gonna hit a lady.

433
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,040
天呐
Oh, my God!

434
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,690
你打碎手骨了
You crushed me!

435
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,350
另外一只手  快点  还得去接我儿子
Next hand. Hurry. I got to pick my boy up from day care.

436
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,160
不不不  我有钱  我有钱
No, no, no, no, no! I got the money, I got the money.

437
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,030
-在哪儿  -康涅狄格州  给我几个小时
- Where? - It's in Connecticut. Just give me a couple hours.

438
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,210
你觉得我傻吗
You think I'm an idiot?

439
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,750
-伸手  -不要不要不要
- Give me that hand! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

440
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,690
-我先把艾尔巴押给你  -什么
- I'll leave you Alba as collateral. - What?!

441
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,750
-快点  -好好好
- Hurry. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

442
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,610
什么  别丢下我
What? Please don't leave me.

443
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,600
艾尔巴  听我说  你得信我啊
Alba, listen to me. You got to trust me right now, okay?

444
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,470
求你相信我吧
Please trust me. 

445
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,220
我不相信你  你给我下药了
No, I don't trust you. You drugged me.

446
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,700
我也是为了你好啊
Well, that was for your own good.

447
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,490
瞧瞧你解放了多少啊
I mean, look how far you've come.

448
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,010
好了  听着  你得帮我这个忙
All right, listen, I need you to do me a favor.

449
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,880
我帮过你  现在换你帮我了
I did you a favor. It's your turn to do me a favor.

450
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,260
好闺蜜就该两肋插刀
That's what best friends do.

451
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,990
我们是好闺蜜吗
We are best friends?

452
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,910
不知道啊  你说呢
Well, I don't know. Are we?

453
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,980
-是  -好了
- Yeah... - All right.

454
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,910
「瞧瞧啊  瞧瞧我
"Meh, meh, meh. Look at me.

455
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,190
我是「上校」  我是战争英雄」
I'm the Colonel. I'm a war hero."

456
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,370
我让你看看什么是战争  你个老东西
I'll show you a war, you old bastard.

457
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,750
你怎么会变成这样啊
What happened to you?!

458
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,110
我以前那么爱你  爷爷
I loved you, Grandpa!

459
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,300
那么爱你
I loved you!

460
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,430
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

461
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,600
没什么  就是冥想呢
Nothing. Just, uh, meditating.

462
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,780
你的脸怎么成这样了
What happened to your face?

463
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,440
那个老妖婆把我的化妆品扔掉了
Oatmeal Boobs threw away my makeup.

464
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,520
你素颜长这样吗
Do you always look like that?

465
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,170
闭嘴吧  我一夜没睡  一直跳舞呢
Shut up. I was up all night dancing the Charleston.

466
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,300
那个老太婆太可怕了
The woman is awful.

467
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,200
谁说不是呢  「上校」毁了我的生活
Tell me about it. The Colonel's ruining my life.

468
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,050
你说什么呢  他已经是个植物人了
What are you talking about? The guy's a vegetable.

469
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,730
他就是心机老头子
He is a manipulative scumbag, 

470
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,650
必须要阻止他
and he needs to be stopped.

471
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,760
听我说完  好吗  因为我知道...
Just hear me out, okay? 'Cause I know that...

472
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,290
谢天谢地你来了  你救救我们吧
Oh, thank God you're here. You got to help us.

473
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,760
你把我们丢给了一个虐待狂
You left us alone with an abusive lunatic.

474
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,940
你脸怎么成这样了
What happened to your face?

475
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,980
-吓人吧  -是啊
- Spooky, right? - Yeah.

476
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,450
你到底要不要帮我们了
Are you gonna help us or not?

477
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,560
各位  我和艾尔巴俩人过得不错...
Guys, Alba and I got a pretty sweet thing going on, so...

478
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,290
开个价吧
Name your price.

479
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,110
你毕竟是家人
Well, you are family.

480
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,520
我得看在家人的情分上打个折
So I guess I'll have to take that into consideration.

481
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,550
就给我四千二吧
I'll come down to $4,200.

482
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,350
怎么这么精确  但好吧
Bizarrely specific but fine.

483
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,660
好  把他们弄出去
Okay, just get them out of here,

484
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,370
因为如果
'cause if I have to scrub 

485
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,590
让我再给「上校」擦洗一次恶心的纹身身子
the Colonel's disgusting tattooed carcass one more time,

486
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,760
我就会疯掉的
I'm gonna lose my mind.

487
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,600
这家伙还有纹身呢  真不错啊
Guy's got tattoos, huh? That's pretty sweet.

488
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,080
有十字架  蜻蜓
He's got a cross, a dragonfly,

489
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,800
-还有吟诵大海的诗词...  -慢着 
- some weird poem about the sea... - Hold on a second.

490
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,180
你有蜻蜓的纹身吗
He has a dragonfly tattoo?

491
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,330
是啊  很大  就在下垂的胸下
Yeah. It's big. It's right on his wrinkly tit.

492
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,750
-在这里  -没错
- Right here? - Yeah.

493
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,790
要搞出大新闻了
Oh, my God.

494
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,540
提比  抱歉就这么闯进来了
Tippy. Hey, super sorry for the barge-in.

495
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,530
-我是米琪  我们通过电...  -我知道你是谁
- I'm Mickey. We spoke... - I know who you are.

496
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,830
你那个风骚姐姐抢走了我儿子
You're the sister of that whore who stole my son.

497
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,590
没错  我是她妹  听着
Yeah. That's me. So, listen,

498
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,510
我跟你说要让你照看孩子们
I know I told you I needed you to watch the kids,

499
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,010
但我这边觉得有义务照顾他们
but a couple things fell through on my end,

500
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,840
所以就不用你再照看了
so we won't be needing you anymore.

501
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,390
很抱歉麻烦你跑来了
Sorry for the inconvenience. 

502
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,400
你离开的时候  可以挑辆车走
Hey, you know what? Grab a car on your way out.

503
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,070
我不打算走
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.

504
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,040
那真太可惜了
Well, that's unfortunate.

505
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,520
你这是逼我揭开一见丑闻
You leave me no choice but to reveal a scandal

506
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,850
不可外扬的家丑
so very scandalous

507
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,270
那会毁了佩莫顿一家的名誉
that it will shatter the foundation of the Pemberton name.

508
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,580
没错  「上校」
That's right, Colonel.

509
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,290
你是采花丛中的小蜜蜂啊
You've been a busy boy, haven't you?

510
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,130
到处拈花惹草
A very bad, busy little boy.

511
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,290
我们都知道「上校」热情似火
Now, we all know the Colonel is a man of many passions.

512
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,780
但女人最能激起他心中的火焰了
But none burn brighter than that of the female flesh.

513
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,800
即便是他  也经不住
Even he was no match for the temptresses

514
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,140
危地马拉岛国妖妇的诱惑
who inhabit the tiny island nation of Guatemala!

515
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,370
-危地马拉不是个岛  -你能不...
- Guatemala isn't an island. - Would you... I...

516
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,040
-我在解决问题呢  -我懂  就是拖得太长了
- I'm doing a thing. - I know. It's just taking forever.

517
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,580
-我马上就说到重点了  -快点说啊
- I'm building up to something. - Build faster.

518
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
你能不打断我吗
Could you stop interrupting me?

519
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,850
-你就稍微...  -谢谢  总之...
- If you just do it... - Yeah, okay! Thank you! Okay. Anyway...

520
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,100
毋庸置疑
there's no denying 

521
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,170
「上校」为危地马拉国
that the Colonel has done a great many things

522
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,330
做了不少贡献
for the landlocked nation of Guatemala.

523
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,030
他会名垂青史  因为他建造了马路  
His legacy will forever be etched in the roads he's paved,

524
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,430
建造学校
the schools he's built,

525
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,860
还留下了他的私生女
and the faces of his bastard children.

526
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,020
没错
That's right.

527
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,280
「上校」是艾尔巴的父亲
The Colonel is Alba's father!

528
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,850
不然他怎么会把蜻蜓纹在心间呢
Why else would he have a dragonfly tattoo over his heart,

529
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,020
绝逼是为了纪念他的「小蜻蜓」
if not to honor his precious libelula?

530
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,390
怎么了  「上校」
What's the matter, Colonel?

531
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,150
说不出话了吗
Cat got your tongue?

532
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,840
我想你说的纹身 
I believe the, uh, tattoo you're referring to

533
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,800
是B4轰炸机
is the B-24 Bomber.

534
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,590
跟他开过太平洋的那架飞机很像
Much like the one he bravely flew over the Pacific.

535
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,520
好吧  好吧
Yeah. Okay. Well, um...

536
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,750
谢谢您为国效力
Thank you for your service.

537
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,680
你跟你姐真是一个德行
You're no different from your sister.

538
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,580
就是一个拜金女
You're just a dimwitted gold digger

539
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,860
赖上佩莫顿这颗摇钱树了
trying to suckle from the mighty Pemberton teat.

540
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,790
只要我还有一口气
Well, so long as I have breath in my body, 

541
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,710
