00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,910
{\an8}衰女翻身 第一季 第三集

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,620
真好呀
Yeah! That's nice!

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,700
大家早安
Good morning, everybody.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,880
这根葱是从哪冒出来的
Who the hell is this clown?

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,860
我是凯
I'm Kai.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,290
他是我男友
He's my boyfriend.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,470
你又是哪根葱
Who are you?

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,500
我是...
Well, I'm...

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,870
我是吉米
I'm Jimmy.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,810
我滴小钢炮呀
My Goodness.

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,820
这俩真把节操当路人啊
They are really going for it, huh?

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,650
爽
Yeah!

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,240
天呐  你就不打算管管吗
Oh, my God, are you really allowing this?

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,510
你想让我怎么管
What do you want me to do about it?

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,000
管管啊  太恶心了
Something, it's disgusting.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,230
把电视声音开大点
Just turn the TV up.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,120
也许很快就会累趴下了
Probably tire themselves out pretty soon.

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,140
我说不清  米琪
Nah, I don't know, Mick.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,160
现在算是你当家吧
It kind of feels like it's your department now.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,740
你这是教我怎么当家长吗
Are you giving me parenting advice?

21
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,850
话说你怎么还赖在这里
Yeah, why are you even here?

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,240
没错  你在这里一无是处
Yeah, true, you contribute nothing.

23
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,950
你们说什么呢
Oh, what the hell are you guys talking about?

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,080
我就相当于父亲的角色
I'm the father figure.

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,880
你喜欢我画的乌龟吗
Do you like my turtle?

26
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,800
不  不太喜欢
no, not really.

27
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:13,860
真会摧残幼小心灵  「老爸」
Good job, Dad.

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,520
我可不会骗小孩子
Well, I'm not gonna lie to the kid.

29
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,390
这下完事了
Oh, there we go.

30
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,720
俩人消停了
Problem solved.

31
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,000
天啊
Oh, my God!

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,810
在不在[敲门]  我进来了
Knock, knock. Can I come in?

33
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,520
你可以真去敲下门
You could also actually knock.

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,280
知道了  最近好吗
Yeah. How's it going?

35
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,970
-一切都好吗  -很好
- Everything good? - Yep.

36
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,900
就玩呗
Just chillin'.

37
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,140
好吧
Yeah, yeah.

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,240
凯啊
So, Kai, huh?

39
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,670
-感觉小伙不错啊  -嗯
- He seems cool. - Yeah.

40
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,920
他是做哪行的  是...
What's his deal? Is he like a...

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,950
-消防员  还是模特啊  -不是
- a fireman or a model or something? - No.

42
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,780
不  他用回收木材做家具
No, he builds furniture out of found wood.

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,960
回收木材
Found wood.

44
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,920
真有这种东西啊
Found wood's a thing.

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,740
你们俩一直上床吧
So, I guess you guys are having sex, huh?

46
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,850
天呐  要来性教育吗
Oh, God, are we having the talk?

47
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,340
不  我可不想谈这事
No, I don't want to have the talk, at all.

48
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,910
我就是想让你知道
Listen, I just wanted to let you know that

49
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,230
我完全能理解
I totally get it and

50
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,260
你挑的男人不是盖的
you picked a good one,

51
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,600
高大威猛  帅气撩人
that guy is a hall of fame piece of ass.

52
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,220
撩得我愿意拜倒在他的胯下...
Oh, man, I'd let him do things to me...

53
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,170
别说了  别意淫了
Please stop! Just stop it.

54
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,760
好吧  重点是
All right, the point is, uh,

55
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,460
你是个女人  有需要  我懂
you're a woman with needs and I get it,

56
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,430
只要你记得用避孕套  就没事
so as long as you're using condoms, I'm cool.

57
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,670
我们不用
We're not.

58
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,570
好吧  也没什么
Oh, okay. Well, that's cool.

59
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,470
你的身体你做主
Your body, your choice.

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,250
我也更愿意吃避孕药
I am more of a pill person myself.

61
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,740
你知道避孕药的害处有多大吗
Do you have any idea how poisonous that stuff is?

62
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,810
避孕怎么就成毒害了  塞布丽娜
How is birth control poison, Sabrina?

63
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,350
药会伤害身体  造成情绪不稳定
It destroys your body and causes crazy mood swings.

64
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,400
宝宝也会啊
So do babies!

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,260
你怎么突然间关心...
Why do you all of a sudden care what...?

66
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,730
我明白了
I get it.

67
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,580
明白什么
Get what?

68
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,760
你羡慕嫉妒恨了
You're jealous.

69
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,690
我羡慕嫉妒恨
I'm jealous? 

70
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,690
-没错  -嫉妒你吗
- Yeah. - What, of you?

71
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,380
我怎么会嫉妒你啊
Why would I be jealous of you?

72
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,210
因为我男人身材爆表  帅出宇宙呗
Maybe because I have a beautiful hunk of beef and you don't.

73
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,360
-我也有男人  -吉米吗
- I got beef. - Who, Jimmy?

74
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,290
丑得惊天动地的衰男吗
That packaged lunch meat?

75
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,690
我男人的姿色甩他几个地球半径呢
I'm over here feasting on filet mignon.

76
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,000
好吧  算了  不想跟你说这个了
All right, you know what? I don't want to have this conversation.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,330
我就是不想你被人搞大肚子
I just don't want you to get pregnant,

78
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,870
不如你就先吃我的药吧
so why don't you just take some of my pills,

79
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,160
稍后你等自己去开点
until you go fill a prescription of your own.

80
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,360
你把避孕药放在塑料袋里吗
You keep your birth control in a plastic bag?

81
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,600
我在网上买的散装药
Well, I buy it in bulk online.

82
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,980
这样更省钱
I find it more cost effective.

83
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,190
我不想吃
I don't want them, okay?

84
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,100
你为什么这么抗拒这药啊
Why are you so resistant to the pill?

85
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,540
这是现代医学奇迹
It's a modern miracle!

86
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,510
这药改革了妇女们的命运
The pill revolutionized everything for women.

87
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,970
使我们女人能够出去工作
We were able to join the workforce.

88
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,240
-让我们...  -你这辈子都没工作过
- It allowed us to... - You never worked a day in your life.

89
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,270
但我想就可以去呀
But I could if I wanted to,

90
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,980
多亏这些「魔力」的药丸
thanks to this magic little pill.

91
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,940
那些药丸具有魔力吗
Those pills are magic?

92
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,190
来吧  本  我问你
Oh, here we go. Ben, let me ask you something.

93
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,070
如果有一种药能够让你
If there was a pill that gave you the freedom

94
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,880
随心所欲
to be anything in the whole world,

95
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,990
-你会吃吗  -必须滴
- would you take it? - Definitely.

96
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,340
瞧瞧  连三岁孩子都明白这个道理
There you go. This kid gets it and he's, like, three.

97
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,290
很好  那就给他吃吧
Great, then he can take 'em. How 'bout that?

98
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,170
行了  你回来
Okay, come back here.

99
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,790
别这样  塞布丽娜
Come on, Sabrina.

100
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,640
你关心我避不避孕干什么
What do you care what I do with my body?

101
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,780
你又不是我妈
You're not my mom.

102
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,810
亲爱的  就我而言
Honey, as far as I'm concerned,

103
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,530
只要我在这个家  我有两个任务
as long as I'm here, I have two jobs:

104
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,630
没人死  没人怀孕
make sure nobody dies or winds up pregnant.

105
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,970
没有死亡  没有出生
No deaths, no births.

106
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,600
你们这样合法吗
Is what you're doing even legal?

107
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,630
你才17岁
You're 17!

108
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,790
他有三十了吧
What is he, like 30?

109
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,700
其实康涅狄格州的法定年龄是16岁
Actually, the age of consent in Connecticut is 16.

110
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,480
什么
What?

111
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,630
康涅狄格州  跟一个16岁的女生上床是合法的
It's cool to have sex with a 16-year-old in the state of Connecticut.

112
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,520
我又没说这很棒
Well, not cool like "awesome."

113
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,880
就是允许而已
Cool like "acceptable."

114
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,780
恶心  你怎么知道的
Gross, how do you know that?

115
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,040
哥就是懂呗
I know what I know.

116
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,360
瓦哈卡州  12岁就可以了
12 in Oaxaca.

117
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,580
正视这个问题吧
Pull your head out of your ass!

118
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,980
这种错误能毁了你一生的
Come on, this is the kind of mistake that could ruin your life.

119
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,530
我不会怀孕的
I'm not gonna get pregnant.

120
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,900
幸亏本少爷不是女生
God, I'm so stoked I'm not a girl.

121
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,240
宝宝太烦人了
Babies freakin' suck. 

122
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,040
这事男人也脱不了干系
Hey, it's a two-way street, pal.

123
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,160
亘古至今  女人就靠「意外怀孕」
Women have trapped men since the dawn of time

124
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,930
绑住男人的
by getting "accidentally" knocked up.

125
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,380
而你  绝对是头号目标
And you, my friend, are a prime target.

126
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,200
如果我是妞儿  我绝逼推到你
If I were a chick, I would take you down.

127
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,320
宝贝
Hey, babe.

128
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,630
吉米  你能跟我去卧室聊聊吗
Jimmy, can I have a word with you in the bedroom for a second?

129
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,590
为什么
Why?

130
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,980
当然可以了  好好好
Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yep.

131
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,020
小伙伴们
Hey, guys.

132
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,410
凯  我能单独跟她聊聊吗
Kai, can you give us a little privacy, please?

133
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,770
-当然可以了  -谢谢
- Oh, yeah, absolutely. - Thanks.

134
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,670
-宝贝  还有需要吗  -没啦[很美]
- Babe, do you need anything? - I'm fine.

135
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,960
你确实美啊
Oh, yeah, you are.

136
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,510
好了  坐过去
Okay. Scooch over.

137
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,770
我坐过来了  不好意思
Here we go. Whoopsie daisy.

138
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,690
听着
So, listen,

139
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,630
我想了一下昨天我们的谈话
I was thinking about our conversation yesterday

140
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,740
我感觉自己有些老妈子上身了
and I feel like I came across kind of naggy.

141
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,470
我很抱歉
And I'm really sorry about that.

142
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,160
因为我懂  带套感觉不爽
Because I get it, condoms suck.

143
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,320
记得我上次谈这事时的反应吗
Remember how I felt about this conversation before?

144
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,200
我还是那个反应
Nothing's changed.

145
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,360
好吧  你先听我说完  好吗
All right, well, just hear me out, okay?

146
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,390
我去了免费诊所
I went down to the free clinic

147
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,480
因为免费  我替你好好「大捞了一把」
and I took full advantage of the "Free" Part for you.

148
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,280
发现  现在的年轻人选择太多了
Turns out, you kids have all sorts of options these days.

149
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,170
-什么  -天呐  简直了  瞧瞧
- What? - I mean, are you kidding me?Look at this.

150
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,310
比如这个  瞧瞧这小玩意
For instance, what's this little guy?

151
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,110
银色小袋子
Cute little silver package.

152
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,710
一个环
A ring!

153
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,460
就像个鱿鱼圈啊  不错
It's like a little piece of calamari. That's cool.

154
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,670
我不知道怎么用...
I don't know what you're supposed--

155
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,860
这要进...
does this go around the...

156
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,520
不不  要先挤压
Oh, no, no. Nope, you squish it,

157
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,170
然后捅进你的...
and you actually stick it up your...

158
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,450
然后...
and you are, uh--

159
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,280
就能覆雨翻云了
you're open for business.

160
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,050
是吗  很不错啊
Oh, yeah? Okay, cool, well,

161
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,220
跟避孕药中的雌激素成分一样
uh, it has the exact same hormones as the pill

162
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,440
还会造成血栓
and it causes blood clots.

163
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,160
别这么矫情行不行
Okay, try not to be a pain in the ass,

164
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,090
还有很多呢
we have a lot more here.

165
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,040
这个小玩意是什么
Now, what is this gizmo?

166
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,080
宫内避孕器
That's an IUD.

167
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,810
-听着就让人反胃  好长啊   -嗯
- Boy, it's off-putting. Very long. - Yeah.

168
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,790
但你知道上面写了什么吗
Oh, but you know what I see here?

169
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,390
无化学成分  无激素添加
No chemicals, no hormones.

170
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,420
-看来就是它啦  -不要
- Looks like we've got a winner! - Nope.

171
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,660
-张开腿  -别...
- Open wide. - Don't even...

172
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,330
「小飞机」要来啦
Yeah, here comes the airplane.

173
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,340
-别闹了  -我要捅进...
- Come on. - I'm gonna shove it all--

174
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,780
-我逗你呢  -我不要
- I'm just kidding. - I don't want it!

175
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,660
-我不会啦  你穿着裤子呢  -天呐
- I won't, you got pants on. - Oh, my God.

176
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,330
这东西的材质是铜
That thing is filled with copper.

177
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,370
来吧  你还想把什么「毒物」
Come on, do you have any other toxins

178
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,460
放进我身体呢
you want to fill me up with?

179
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,430
天呐  我这辈子没见过
Oh, my God, you are the dumbest smart person

180
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,580
你这么蠢的聪明人
I have ever met in my life.

181
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,320
好吧  你不想用避孕套
Fine, you don't want to use condoms,

182
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,570
我就只能当「避孕套」了
I guess I'll have to be the condom.

183
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,690
恶心死了  你什么意思
Gross, what does that even mean?

184
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,580
只要有我在
It means I will see to it 

185
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,830
你和凯就别想无套做爱了
that you and Kai never have unprotected sex.

186
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,890
-怎么做  -我一没工作  二没爱好
- How? - I don't have a job or any hobbies;

187
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,970
我会想个招的
I'll figure something out.

188
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,930
米琪
Hey, Mickey.

189
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,220
你得签个字
I need your signature.

190
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,580
一向不爱签字
Yeah, I'm not big on paper trails.

191
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,220
这是干什么用的
What's it for?

192
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,430
我想了一下吉米的话
Well, I thought about what Jimmy said

193
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,360
我要去做结扎手术
and I'm gonna get a vasectomy.

194
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,380
结扎吗  你说什么呢
A vasectomy? What the hell are you talking about?

195
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,610
吉米说得对  我是被推到的主要目标
Jimmy's right, I got a big-ass target on my back.

196
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,390
吉米
Jimmy!

197
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,310
想想吧
Think about it: 

198
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,810
我帅气多金又有才
I'm rich, i'm smart,

199
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,570
我就是「国民老公」啊
I look like a freakin' movie star,

200
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,530
性格又好
I'm kind,

201
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,900
还是个当爹的料
and I'd make a great dad.

202
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,300
外面那些网红锥子脸那么有心机
It's only a matter of time until some gold-digging whore

203
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,190
我迟早会着了她们的道
lures me into her honey trap.

204
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:01,850
怎么了
What's up? 

205
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,080
奇普要去做结扎手术
Chip here is thinking about getting a vasectomy.

206
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,870
好极了  你想让我送他过去吗
Oh, right on. You want me to drive him or something?

207
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,780
不想  因为不能让他结扎
No, I don't, because he's not getting one.

208
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,190
我的身体
Hey, this is my body.

209
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,540
我的身体  我做主
I should be able to do whatever the hell I want with it!

210
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,650
-说得有道理  -行了  你就别多嘴了
- He's got a point. - Nah, don't you-- don't start.

211
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,490
不能让他去切蛋蛋  吉米
He's not getting his balls chopped off, Jimmy, okay?

212
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,090
不是切蛋蛋
Okay, that's not how it works.

213
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,440
其实只是个小手术
It's actually a pretty simple procedure.

214
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,310
夹住  剪开  封住
They clamp it, snip it, seal it.

215
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,400
我做过好几次了  结扎  解结扎...
I've had it done a couple times and reversed, so...

216
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,110
可他还没亲过女生呢
Okay, he hasn't even kissed a girl yet.

217
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,690
我亲过女生  亲过老多女生了
I've kissed girls, okay? I kiss-- I kiss mad girls!

218
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,810
行  证明一下吧
All right, prove it.

219
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,410
用你的手做示范  演示你怎么亲女生
Kiss your hand, show me how you kiss all these girls.

220
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,310
好
Okay...

221
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,230
别笑了  这不好笑
Stop laughing, it's not funny!

222
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,680
-抱歉  -怎么了啊
- I'm sorry. - What's going on?

223
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,630
没什么
Oh, nothing,

224
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,150
我就是拿奇普开涮
we're just, um, making fun of Chip

225
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,570
因为他没亲过女生
'cause he's never kissed a girl.

226
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,470
别着急  小家伙
don't sweat it, little man.

227
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,710
我三年级才亲上女生呢
I didn't have my first kiss till the third grade.

228
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,900
我13岁了
Well, I'm 13.

229
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,510
其实也没什么大不了
Well, there's nothing to it.

230
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,500
你只要闭上眼晴
All you got to do is just close your eyes,

231
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,740
让一切水到渠成
just let the wave wash over you.

232
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,260
不行  够了  好了
No, no, okay, all right, all right,

233
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,530
等下  停下  慢着
hold on. H-Hey. Hang on a second. Wait!

234
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,320
别亲了  别亲了
Just stop. Stop! Stop it!

235
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,770
给我打住
I mean... Stop!

236
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,240
出去  很好  很好
Get out. Good, good.

237
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,560
很好  真好啊
Good, really good.

238
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,990
身材不错  马一样健壮
Healthy. Healthy as a horse.

239
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,320
吉米  谈一下
Jimmy, a word.

240
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,470
什么
What?

241
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,960
天呐
Oh, my God.

242
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,900
你干什么啊
What are you doing?

243
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,870
不是吧
Oh, come on.

244
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,430
这样才对嘛
Yeah! There we go.

245
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,530
这里臭气熏天啊
Stinks in here.

246
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,810
该流通一下空气了
Get a little air flow going.

247
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,710
你脑子有病啊
What are you, insane?

248
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,790
除了盯着我  你就没事干了吗
You have nothing better to do than to stalk me?

249
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,680
{\an8}避孕套

250
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,920
你们出个声同意就行了
You guys just say the word.

251
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,010
给我吧  我们会试的  你个蛇精病
Just give 'em to me, we'll try 'em, you maniac.

252
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,990
这才像话嘛
Now we're talking.

253
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,380
你们爽翻吧
You kids go nuts.

254
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,630
怎么了啊  小少爷
What is the problem, slugger?

255
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,160
我们学校的女生都是可怕的女汉子
All the girls at my school are stupid trolls!

256
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,630
你来找我就对了
Oh, well, you were smart to come to me.

257
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,420
我没找你  你跑到我屋里来了
I didn't, you walked into my room.

258
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,550
不要在意细节
Yeah, either way.

259
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,030
说说这些女汉子吧  小子
Tell me about these trolls, pal.

260
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,020
她们...
They're--

261
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,030
她们不可怕  就是...
they're not trolls, okay, they just...

262
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,940
她们...
they won't...

263
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,960
如果我告诉你
Okay, if I tell you,

264
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,700
你得保证守口如瓶
you have to promise not to tell anybody.

265
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,920
当然了
Yeah, of course.

266
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,460
米琪没说错  我没亲过女生
Mickey's right, I never... kissed a girl, ever.

267
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,790
我学了凯的路数
I tried to do it like Kai,

268
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,190
但结果不是人见人爱  而是人见人踹
but they all treated me like I had freakin' AIDS.

269
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,340
好吧  那确实很无知  很不近人情
Okay, that's ignorant and insensitive,

270
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,080
我懂被人拒绝的滋味
but I get how it feels to be rejected.

271
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,680
信我
Trust me, uh...

272
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,340
而至于凯
All right, and Kai,

273
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,140
他帅到没朋友...
he's so good looking, it's--

274
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,510
我要是女人  都想找他来一发
I wouldn't mind taking a run at him myself.

275
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,430
而且因为他的存在
And he is really giving your aunt and I

276
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,520
你小姨和我才有性福可享
a jump-start in the bedroom.

277
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,250
恶心  老兄  少儿不宜啊
Oh, gross, dude. Know your audience.

278
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,510
抱歉  我只是想说
I'm sorry. Look, all I'm saying is

279
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,470
你得做自己  懂吗
you got to be yourself, okay.

280
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,210
别想着凯和他的颜值了
Forget Kai and his looks.

281
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,970
你拥有的东西  他未必有
You've got things that he doesn't have, right?

282
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,100
你得发挥你的长处
You got to play to those, play to your strengths.

283
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,900
对  发挥我的优势
Right, play to my strengths.

284
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,660
-谢谢  吉米  -没事
- Thank you, Jimmy. - Yeah.

285
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,910
楼上搞什么呀
What the heck is going on up there?

286
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,900
你姐正被搞...  正搞一些家具呢
Your sister's getting fu... rniture... delivered.

287
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,410
画得不错
Pretty cool drawing.

288
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,060
不是  画得太差了
No, it's not. It's terrible.

289
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,600
你这么成天盯着我
And how am I supposed to make anything good

290
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,870
我怎么画好啊
when you won't stop breathing down my neck?!

291
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,460
小本本  你咋啦
Whoa, Benny, what is going on with you, bud?

292
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,580
最近这么暴躁
You're so moody these days.

293
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,290
米琪小姐  这是我在塞布丽娜的垃圾桶里看到的
Ms. Mickey? Look, I found these in Sabrina's trash.

294
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,400
不是吧
Are you serious?

295
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,760
你得答应我  你不会让她被搞大肚子 
You have to promise me you will not let her get pregnant, okay--

296
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,770
你发誓
prometame.

297
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,740
我发誓
I prometa. Okay?

298
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,160
我已经养大了塞布丽娜  奇普和本
I already raised Sabrina, Chip, and Ben.

299
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,660
再多一个宝宝  我会崩坏的  成天哭闹
I cannot do another, not with all the crying and the--

300
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,500
- 整夜不睡觉  还得换尿片  -我懂  好了
- and the no sleeping and the diapers. - I get it. Hey, hey, yes...

301
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,280
-屎尿成灾啊  -我明白了  好了
- There are just so many diapers. - I understand, okay.

302
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,080
不不不  你不懂
No, no, no, you don't understand.

303
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,040
我母乳喂养了那三个孩子
I breastfed all three of them.

304
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,980
我的奶子已经变成咬成口香糖了
My nipples are like old chewing gum.

305
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,520
我不听我不听  你够啦
No, no, no, but come on, good God, that's enough.

306
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,810
我会想个招的
I'll figure it out, okay.

307
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,140
就再跟我提你奶子的事了
I don't want to hear about your nipples anymore.

308
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,260
-行吗  -没问题  没问题
- Are we cool on that? - Yeah, we're good. We're good.

309
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,430
-这就好  -但我们得棒打鸳鸯了
- Okay, good. - But we got to keep her from seeing him.

310
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,420
这招只会有反效果
No, that's the classic thing. 

311
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,410
越是阻止她们交往
If we forbid her to see him,

312
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,920
她就会越想跟他在一起
she's just going to want him more.

313
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,510
我们得让她甩了他
We got to make her break up with him.

314
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,580
怎么了
What?

315
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,660
老娘要上了那个小鲜肉
I'm going to bang his beautiful brains out.

316
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,230
-够狠  -没错
- Oh... yeah. - Oh... yeah.

317
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,920
米琪  我感觉这不太好
Mickey, I got a bad feeling about this.

318
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,810
塞布丽娜知道你上了她男友
Sabrina is going to do the murder to you

319
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,430
她会杀了你
if you sleep with Kai.

320
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,360
没事  她很快就不会计较了
Yeah, well, she'll get over it.

321
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,090
我觉得这么损的招  该由我来出手
I think it should be me who carries out this despicable act.

322
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,210
艾尔巴  你肯献身真大度啊
Oh, Alba, that is very generous of you,

323
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,480
但不用了
but not necessary.

324
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,690
你已经为这个家做得太多了
You already do so much for this family.

325
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,880
其实也没做多少
Oh, well, I really don't do a lot,

326
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,980
我最近一直偷懒
and I've been slacking off.

327
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,180
没事  我来出马吧
Yeah, it's okay. I-- I do this.

328
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,590
你太贴心了  但是呢
Yeah, super thoughtful, but you know what?

329
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,600
问题是这样
Here's the thing.

330
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,840
凯都「久经情场」了
Kai's a thoroughbred, right, 

331
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,720
还是派我这种经验丰富的「骑师」搞定吧
and we really need an experienced jockey riding that horse.

332
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,160
但如果我能...
Yeah, but if I could just take a...

333
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,020
别跟老娘抢男人  艾尔巴  我来出马
Back off, Alba, okay? I'm doing my plan.

334
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,130
有人吗  女士
Hello? Ma'am?

335
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,150
能让你听个动静就知足吧
Just be grateful you get to listen.

336
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,030
-有人吗  -你好啊
-Hello? - Oh, hey, you.

337
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,110
我收到你的短信了
I got your message.

338
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,390
你的床出问题了吗
There's something wrong with your bed?

339
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,880
直接切入正题啊
Jumping right into it, huh?

340
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,390
姐喜欢  想喝杯酒吗
I like that. Want to have a drink first?

341
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,800
不用了  不喝
Oh, no, I'm okay. 

342
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,950
我要干活  不能喝酒
You know, booze and power tools.

343
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,620
好吧  我替你喝了
All right, I'll take yours.

344
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,930
这床出什么问题了
So, um, what seems to be the problem over here?

345
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,650
「她」就像裤门大开「叫个不停」呢
Oh, man, she's creaking like a barn door.

346
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,900
-是吗  -没错
- Oh, yeah? - Yep.

347
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,380
我应该能拧紧一些螺丝
Well, I guess I could tighten a few screws,

348
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,100
但我看着挺好呢
but it looks good to me.

349
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,780
我看着也挺好呢
It looks good to me, too.

350
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,290
好吧  我来看看
Yeah, okay. Um, let's see.

351
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,300
还是没听到任何声响
Yeah, you know, I'm still not really hearing anything.

352
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,780
你没听到吗  好吧
You're not hearing it? Yeah.

353
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,320
我知道问题出在哪儿了
Oh, I think I know what the problem is.

354
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,790
一般我会跳上床「上位」
Normally I'm, huh, on top of it

355
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,930
才会听到叫声  懂我意思吗
when I'm hearing the noises, you know what I mean?

356
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,990
就像...
It's, kind of, like...

357
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,850
这样一直叫个不停呢
squeak... squeak... squeak, squeak.

358
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,300
你听到了吗
You hearing it at all?

359
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,140
没有  没听到
Yeah, you know, I'm not hearing it.

360
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,020
好吧  那我们重新再来一次吧
Oh, okay. Well, then I guess let's just start over.

361
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,760
我们不用去多想
We don't have to overthink it.

362
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,100
-我们到床下  解决...  -不要
- Let's go under the bed and we'll figure out sort of a... - N-No.

363
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,630
我就是想离开这里
I just want to get out of this here.

364
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,010
我还是...  败给你了
You know what, maybe I should-- okay.

365
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,670
-等下  等下  -好吧
- Well, hold on. Hang on a second. - Okay.

366
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,080
如果你给我几秒钟  我们就能...
I think if we-- you just gave me a second, we could--

367
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,710
摔得我心慌慌啊
My goodness, what a launch.

368
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,720
你要走了吗  走吧  滚出我房间
Are you-- are you leaving? Leave. Get out of here.

369
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,890
滚出我房间
Get out of my room. 

370
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,500
滚出去  别再回来了
Get out of my room and do not come back.

371
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,350
我要是出马  就拿下了
I could've closed the deal.

372
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,000
人艰不拆  艾尔巴  人艰不拆
Not now, Alba, okay? Not now.

373
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,250
那个小贱人  她想怀孕  行行
Oh, that bitch, if she wants to get pregnant, fine, fine.

374
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,480
我们就让她怀孕
We're going to help her get pregnant.

375
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,440
小黛
Hey, Steffi.

376
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,670
奇普
Hey, Chip.

377
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,040
你参加那个数学考试了吗
So, uh, did you take that math test?

378
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,640
天呐  太难了
Oh, my God, it was so hard.

379
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,020
就是啊  这是代数
Right? It's like, are we in algebra or,

380
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,290
还是空间研究计划啊
like, the freakin' space program?

381
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,820
「地球呼叫代数  没人待见你」
Like, "Earth to algebra, nobody likes you."

382
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,390
不错吧  好玩吧
So cool, cool... chill.

383
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,240
我就是觉得
Well, I just, like, think you're really,

384
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,970
你特别漂亮  人也特别好
really pretty and, like, super cool,

385
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,560
我很喜欢跟你在一起
and I like hanging out with you and stuff.

386
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,880
你这人很好相处
And, like, you're super freakin' chill 

387
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,330
跟你处得很开心
and, like, all that good stuff.

388
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,870
奇普  不用这么紧张
Chip, you don't have to be so nervous.

389
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,200
直接问我吧
You can just ask.

390
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,360
好
Okay.

391
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,280
我就是想知道...
Well, I was just wondering if I--

392
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,380
-我能给你五百块让你跟我亲热吗  -什么
- I could pay you $500 to make out with me? - What?

393
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,800
你值更多  一千块
Um, you're better than that. $1,000.

394
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,240
你个混蛋
You jerk.

395
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,250
天呐  艾尔巴  你在那杯奶昔里放了多少催吐剂啊
Damn, Alba, how much ipecac did you put in that smoothie?

396
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,570
我就是想造成害喜的假象
I'm just trying to fake morning sickness,

397
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,900
不是让她吐死
not blow her guts out.

398
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,250
我又不是你  总给人下药
I'm sorry I'm not the expert drugger like you.

399
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,110
确实不是  所以你们幸好有我
No, you're not. You guys are lucky to have me here.

400
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,380
瞧我在网上买到什么了  假的验孕棒
Look what I got online, a bunch of fake pregnancy tests.

401
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,910
我换掉了普多洗手台下面的真验孕棒
I replaced them with all the ones under Poodle's sink.

402
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,050
一般把验孕棒给男人看
You hand a guy something like this,

403
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,710
他就直接甩你钱去处理掉
he just starts throwing cash at you, no questions asked.

404
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,940
我称之为「六百块脱胎换骨」
I like to call it the $600 shuffle.

405
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,780
我听完之后  内心无比压抑
Yeah, now I just feel depressed.

406
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,080
你们俩捣鼓什么呢
What are you two doing?

407
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,270
没什么呀  我们就是
Oh, us? Nothing. We're-- we're just,

408
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,780
-就是随便聊聊  -嗯
- you know, we're hanging out. - Yeah.

409
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,820
不是  你俩表现很诡异
No, you're acting weird.

410
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
我们没有
No, we are not.

411
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,310
我们俩可正常了
We are acting as regular as can be.

412
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,920
嗯
Yeah.

413
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,910
你们就是  我知道原因
Yes, you are, and I know why.

414
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,600
你们不敢明说讨厌我的画
You don't want to tell me that you hate my drawing.

415
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,930
你觉得我我没有画画的天赋
You think I don't have control of the marker,

416
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,360
我搞艺术就是浪费生命
and this whole art thing is a waste of my time.

417
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,160
不用你们说了  我已经造啦
Well, you don't have to tell me because I already know.

418
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,690
真是个熊孩子
What a dick.

419
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,920
那小家伙怎么了
What's wrong with him?

420
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,570
不知道  你怎么了
I don't know. What's wrong with you?

421
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,060
-你看起来不太好啊  -是啊
- You look horrible. - Oh, yeah.

422
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,750
我病了一天了  不知道怎么了
Well, I've been sick all day. I don't know.

423
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,700
以后上学期间不能再喝酒了
I think I got to stop drinking on school nights, you know?

424
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,550
-也许你肚子里有了宝宝呢  -好了
- Or maybe you have a baby inside you. - Oh, okay.

425
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,840
那不可能  她一直都用避孕套了吧
Well, that's not possible 'cause she's using condoms, right?

426
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,690
-没错  当然了  -我就是随口一说
- Right. Yeah, of course. - Yeah, I'm just saying,

427
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,610
不如你去普多卫生间找个验孕棒
maybe you want to take one of the pregnancy tests

428
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,930
验一下吧  保险起见嘛
in Poodle's bathroom, you know, just to be sure.

429
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,310
她说得有道理  验下又无妨
She's got a good point. It couldn't hurt.

430
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,720
但我不...
Well, I-- I mean, I don't...

431
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,060
天呐  快去吐吧
Oh, no. Get it out.

432
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,420
不是吧
Oh, no, no.

433
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,280
她那么瘦
She's a tiny person.

434
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
一小滴就行了  懂吗
Just a little drip, you know what I mean?

435
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,680
小子  很高兴你打来找了我
Hey, buddy, I'm glad you called.

436
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,410
-我找的是米琪  -我来了
- I called Mickey. - Yeah, well, I'm here.

437
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,060
-有什么问题  -你就是问题
- What's the problem? - You're the problem.

438
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,160
我照你说的做了  发挥我的优势
I-I did what you said. I played to my strengths,

439
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,440
结果小黛把我的蛋蛋踢碎了
and Steffi booted my nuts into my throat.

440
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,190
没事  别担心  会康复的
Yeah. Well, don't worry, they'll drop back down.

441
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,370
-我讨厌女生  -别这样
- I freakin' hate girls. - Hey, come on.

442
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,110
你还这么年轻  生活才刚刚开始
You're a young man. This is just beginning.

443
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,810
说句实话吧
All right? And to tell you the truth,

444
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,250
我怀念以前女生爆我蛋蛋来着
I miss the days girls were blasting me in the junk.

445
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,620
你是他父亲吗
Are you the father?

446
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,070
今天算是
I am today.

447
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,000
他的扫描结果没什么问题
Well, his scans look okay.

448
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,480
希望疼肿几天后会慢慢消退
Hopefully the pain and swelling will subside in the next few days,

449
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
但如果没有
but if not,

450
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,700
可能表示问题比较严重  甚至可能不育
that could mean something more serious, maybe even infertility.

451
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,240
这是什么意思
What does-- what does that mean?

452
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,850
他...
Well, his...

453
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,670
这表示你如愿以偿了
I think it means you got your wish.

454
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,300
恭喜你第一次「结扎」
Congrats on your first vasectomy.

455
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,380
我越想就越觉得
And the more that I think about it, 

456
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,400
生不了孩子也没什么
it's not the worst thing I can't have kids--

457
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,650
我可以领养啊
I can always adopt.

458
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,430
谁被你领养真是倒八辈子血霉了
I would not wish that on any abandoned child in the world.

459
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,350
米琪  她来了
Mickey. She's coming.

460
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,440
-是吗  -她来了  来了
- Yeah? - She's coming, she's coming.

461
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,150
好了好了  别太激动  装一下
Okay, okay. Shh. Keep a straight face, okay.

462
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,280
淡定一些
All right, play it cool. 

463
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,290
我们要让她被自己蠢哭
We're going to make her look like a real scumbag.

464
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,010
-她肯定会崩坏的  -没错
- She is going to freak. - Yeah.

465
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,520
各位
Hi, everybody.

466
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,070
我和凯有消息宣布
Uh, so, Kai and I, we have some news.

467
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,860
什么消息  我怎么可能会知道呢
What? What is this news? I don't know what it could be.

468
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,870
好了  什么消息啊
Okay, what is the news?

469
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,530
我不知道怎么开口  我就...
I don't really know how to say this, so I'm just gonna...

470
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,650
-就直接说了  -说吧
- put it out there. - Go for it.

471
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,570
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

472
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,590
这下好了  佩莫顿的第一条分支血脉
There we go. The first dilution of the Pemberton bloodline.

473
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,940
我太惊讶了
Well, this is shocking.

474
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,850
我之前完全不知情
I had zero ideas about this.

475
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,190
谁知道这是真的啊  真丢脸啊
Who would ever know this to be true? Shame, shame.

476
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,840
如你所见  我们很惊讶
As you can see, we are shocked, okay,

477
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,240
你就是个白痴  塞布丽娜
and you are a moron, Sabrina.

478
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,930
你怎么能这样呢
How could you do this? 

479
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,880
我就跟你说会这样了
I told you this was going to happen.

480
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,590
你说得对  我就是个大白痴
You were right. I'm a big stupid idiot.

481
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,930
我的人生就此完了
My whole life is ruined.

482
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,070
你对「我家」闺女做了什么  你个畜...
What did you do to our little girl, you son of...?

483
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,690
别别别  别动手  住手
No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop it. No, no, no.

484
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,960
抱歉  两位  抱歉
It's a-- sorry. You guys, I'm sorry.

485
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,270
这是个误会
This is a big misunderstanding.

486
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,100
这位大姐  恕我直言  我来哄她
Ma'am, ma'am, with all due respect, I got this.

487
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,390
宝贝  看着我  我爱你
Babe, babe, look at me, okay. Listen to me, I love you.

488
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,090
我们就要有宝宝了
And we're going to have a baby.

489
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,220
-这就是问题了  -这位大姐
- Yeah, well, that's the thing. - Ma'am!

490
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,660
这多棒啊
How cool is that?

491
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,110
我可以给宝宝造张床  造个小木马
I get to build him a crib and a rocking horse,

492
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,450
还要建个小房子放这些
and a whole friggin' house to put it all in.

493
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,530
我是说
I mean...

494
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,270
这么说吧
you know what?

495
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,200
豁出去了
Screw it.

496
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,450
-这是什么剧本啊  -这位大姐
- What the hell is happening? - Ma'am!

497
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,750
塞布丽娜·佩莫顿
Sabrina Pemberton,

498
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,490
我爱你
I love you.

499
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,060
你愿意嫁给我吗  宝贝
Will you marry me, baby?

500
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,620
我愿意
Yes, I will marry you.

501
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,310
好吧  我刚才要说的问题就是
Okay, great. Yeah, that's the thing I was going to say

502
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,080
她没怀孕
is that she's not pregnant.

503
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,440
-没事了  -什么
- That's good. - What?

504
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,580
她没怀孕  你没怀孕
She's not pregnant. You're not pregnant.

505
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,590
-什么意思  -我和艾尔巴...
- What do you mean? - Alba and I--

506
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,180
我们想让你吸取教训  所以我们...
well, we wanted to teach you a lesson, you know, so we...

507
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,590
希望你吸取教训了
So I-I hope you learned.

508
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,970
演不下去了  脱离剧本了
I can't-- it's gone off the rails a bit.

509
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,480
我不知道怎么演下去
I'm not really sure...

510
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,490
好吧  谢谢你
Okay. Well, thank you.

511
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,720
不客气
Yes, you're welcome.

512
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,180
谢什么啊
Wait, for what?

513
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,050
如果你没这么做
Well, if you didn't do that, 

514
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,340
我就不会知道凯是个负责任的好男人
I never would've found out what an amazing man Kai is.

515
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,640
天呐  你还是想娶我吗
Oh, my God, do you still want to marry me?

516
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,980
-啥  -非常想
- What? - More than anything.

517
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,980
没怀孕  假怀孕
No. No baby, fake baby.

518
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,390
你说的都是一个意思
Yeah, that's the same thing, though.

519
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,670
听到了吗  都是一个意思
You hear that? It's kind of the same thing.

520
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,470
塞布丽娜要结婚了
Sabrina's getting married

521
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
等下
Wait...

522
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,390
塞布丽娜要结婚了
Sabrina's getting married?

523
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,380
这小家伙到底是怎么了
Okay, what the hell's going on with this one?

524
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,860
我又开心  又难过
I'm happy and sad...

525
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,730
还很生气
and mad.

526
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,020
小本本  你究竟是咋啦
Come on, Ben, what's going on with you, buddy?

527
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,160
我就是个没艺术细胞的小废柴
I'm just a big, fat, no-talent loser.

528
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,060
即使你的「魔力药丸」都拯救不了我
Even your magic pills couldn't help.

529
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,850
-什么「魔力药丸」  -你包里的那些啊
- What magic pills? - The ones in your purse.

530
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,400
我换成了其他药
I filled with other pills 

531
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,560
这样就不会被抓包
so I wouldn't get in trouble.

532
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,250
你是说我的避孕药吗
You are talking about my birth control?

533
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,010
这可不妙  因为我和吉米最近经常「运动」
That's not good, 'cos Jimmy and I have been... a lot.

534
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,000
-我要当爹啦  -不不不
- I am gonna be a dad. - No, no, no.

535
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,190
我要当爹啦
I am gonna be a dad.
