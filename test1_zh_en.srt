三号收银台  查下价
Price check, register three.

2
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,250
他们在茧里  醒来时
They're in this cocoon, but they wake up

3
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,970
-一切混沌有如原生汤...  -原生汤  我知道
- and it's like a primordial soup. - Soup, I know.

4
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,690
-嘴跟屁股颠倒了  -别说了
- And their mouth is the butt... and the butt's the mouth, which is...  - Please stop....

5
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,610
我知道  我都知道了
I know. I already know!

6
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,880
我就是不想再听一遍  恕我直言  
I just don't want to hear it again, no offense.

7
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,730
说得我都烦了
I..., you're driving me nuts.

8
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,600
我太兴奋了
I'm excited!

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,980
我从没去过豪宅
I've never been to a mansion before!

10
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,510
我不是去探亲  懂吗
Well, it's not a social visit, all right?

11
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,570
我姐特别讨厌
My sister sucks.

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,560
别这样  怎么说也是你姐
Hey, okay. That's your sister.

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,390
-你还看不起你姐呢  -是
- Yeah, you despise your sister.- Yeah, well,

14
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,760
因为我姐穷个叮当响  
 'cause my sister's a locksmith.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,080
蜗居一族
She lives in a box.

16
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,670
你姐可是个大款
Your sister's a freakin' millionaire.

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,130
她才不是  她是嫁了个大款
Well, no, she married a millionaire;

18
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,460
区别大着呢
there's a big difference.

19
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,680
这豪宅真是富得流油啊
Baby got a big old butt!

20
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,490
-那是汽油  -什么

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,250
天呐  怎么会是汽油
My God! Why do you have gasoline?

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,030
我这叫省钱有道
Well, I'm not gonna pay Greenwich prices.

23
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,250
-那就把气油装在果汁瓶里吗  -是啊  
- So you keep it in a juice jug?! - Yeah.

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,800
你喷得前面都是油
You spit all over my dash.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,020
那你想让我怎么样
What'd you want me to do with it?

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,700
谁知道  就...
I don't know, deal with...

27
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,950

28
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,800
-把汽油藏起来  -为什么
- Put the gas away. - Why?

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,280
我能搞定
I got this.

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,070
-为什么  -我能搞定
- Why, why? - I got you, I got you.

Howdy. Everything okay here?

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,540
-原来是个保安  -没事
- Security. - Yeah.

33
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,390
我们没事  也用不着你管
Yeah. We're fine, not that it's any of your concern.

34
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,730
-你们迷路了吗  -没有
- You guys lost? - No.

35
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,200
我姐住在这里
My sister lives here.

36
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,370
好吧  别惹乱子
Okay. Stay out of trouble.

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,970
遵命  「长官」
Will do, Officer.

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,970
什么情况  看不起穷人呗
What the hell was that? Guy treats us like a bunch of lowlifes?

39
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,890
格林威治的人就这个德行
Yeah, welcome to Greenwich.

40
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,410
我该朝他吐口痰
Yeah, I should have spit on him.

41
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,850
杰米  你上哪儿
Jimmy, where you going?

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,050
去野餐烧烤宴啊
To the barbecue.

43
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,820
不  你不跟我一起去
No. No, you're not coming in with me.

44
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,100
为什么呢
Why not?

45
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,630
因为你让我觉得丢脸
'Cause your embarrassing. You embarrass me.

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,760
你层次太低了呗
I'm embarrassed of you.

47
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,970
那我大老远从罗得岛开过来干什么
Then why the hell did I just drive up here from Rhode Island?

48
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,180
不开车  我就能喝酒啊
So I can drink.

49
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,720
听下比赛吧
Just pop on the game.

50
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,550

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,040
-能给我一支烟吗  -不行
- Can I bum a smoke, please? - No.

55
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,130
好吧  算你狠  给你一块钱
Well... okay, fine. I'll kick you a dollar.

56
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,700
不用了  我有钱  谢了
It's okay, I already have a dollar. Thank you, though.

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,740
烟友之间
Well, it's just kind of customary

58
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,720
相互给支烟是规矩
to help out a fellow smoker in need.

59
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,070
我感觉你经常跟人借烟吧
I get the sense that you're in need a lot.

60
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,320
你怎么回事
What's your problem?

61
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,110
我没问题啊
I don't have a problem.

62
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,500
有问题的是你  不然也不会跟我墨迹
You do. Otherwise, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

63
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,200
-抱歉打扰了  -本姑娘不计较
- Sorry to bother you. - It's okay.

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,530

65
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,700
-贱人  -茶婊
- Bitch! - Bitch.

66
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,560
别紧张  妈妈  苹果酒而已

67
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,210
大家好  我叫奇普·佩莫顿

- This is the Mickey that I know. - What are you talking about?

115

我在你这年纪一半的时候就成家了
I was half your age when I settled down.

116
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,200
什么成家啊  你被有钱佬搞大肚子
Settle down? You got knocked up by some rich guy

117
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,130
当时你是脱衣舞郎

我是在脱衣舞俱乐部当服务生

你是个裸上身的服务生
You were a topless waitress.

120
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,640
那更可怜  因为你不会跳舞
And that's even worse; it just means you couldn't dance.

121
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,780
我很会跳舞
I am a great dancer.

122

Who was that?

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,240
不是吧
What?!

128
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,030

135
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,420
不不  你让他们明早按时上学就行了
No, no. You just need to get them to school in the morning, okay?

136
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,570
整件事就是个误会
This whole thing is a huge misunderstanding.

137
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,130
戴帽子那个邻居呢
Have that neighbor lady, the one with the hat?

138
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,940
绝对不行  我可不放心
Absolutely not. I'd never hear the end of it.

139
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,430
保姆  你们有保姆吧
Babysitter? Don't you have a babysitter?

140
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,750
让五金店外面
I know! Get one of those guys

141
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,630
那些闲人来看孩子吧
outside the hardware store to-to do it. They'll do it.

142
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,240
米琪  我现在没辙了[被铐了]
Mickey. My hands are kind of tied right now.

143
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,050
别整乱我发型啊
Okay, watch the hair.

144
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,840
听着  你就当一天孩子们的小姨
Listen, just act like their aunt for one day

145
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,380
你想要多少钱  我都给
and I'll get you the money that you need, okay?

146
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,020
别把孩子们玩坏了
And don't ruin them!

147
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,370
你们的父母很安全
So... your parents are safe

148
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,470
他们就是想
and they just wanted to see

149
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,720
在事情都解决好之前
if I could spend a little time with you guys

150
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,430
让我多陪陪你们
while this whole thing gets sorted.

151
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,820
会解决的  懂吗
It will get sorted, okay?

152
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,510
等解决完
And when it does,

153
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,560
那些联调局探员就会坐穿牢底了
those FBI pigs will be the ones rotting in jail.

154
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,040
爸爸妈妈坐牢了吗
Mommy and Daddy are in jail?

155
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,070
别担心  本
Don't worry, Ben.

156
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,940
这世道有钱能使鬼推磨
The scales of justice tip in favor of the wealthy.

157
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,510
只要甩他们一脸钱  就搞定了
If we throw enough money at this thing, I'm sure it will go away.

158
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,360
然后我们就以诽谤罪告死他们
And then we'll sue their asses for defamation,

159
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,610
-懂了吗  -懂啦
- okay? - Okay.

160
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,670
这也行
Okay.

161
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,680
我有个主意
So, I have an idea.

162
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,110
不如我们今晚都窝在家里玩扑克吧
Why don't we all just hunker down and play poker all night long,

163
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,070
直到这事都搞定
until this whole thing blows over?

164
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,800
你就别指望我会待在家了 
That's not gonna work for me.

165
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,890
我要去参加计划生育的募捐晚宴
Yeah, I'm gonna go to this fund-raiser for Planned Parenthood.

166
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,620
晚上会睡朋友家  明天进城
Probably crash at my friend's place, go to the city tomorrow.

167
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,370
反正我是不着家
So just don't expect to see me too much.

168
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,800
咱俩应该见不着
You know, we probably won't see each other at all.

169
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,590
等再过十年  
But hey, let's catch up again

170
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,550
你再来借钱时见吧
in ten years when you need another loan.

171
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,760
听着  塞布丽娜  我指望这事翻身
Listen, Sabrina, I got a lot riding on this gig,

172
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,740
你能不给我
so can you do me a favor

173
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,010
整这些幺蛾子吗
and not be a big, giant, pain in the ass, please?

174
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:47,970
也许你没文化  不知道
Maybe you don't know this,

175
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,090
计划生育组织
but Planned Parenthood provides

176
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,080
为全国超过三百万女性提供医保吗
health care to over three million women in this country.

177
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,670
小丫头  我很了解计划生育
Sweetie, I know all about Planned Parenthood.

178
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,190
我去过好多次  
I should have one of those punch cards

179
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,370
都应该给我积分卡了
that gets you a free sub every ten visits.

180
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,540
真恶心
Gross.

181
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,200
不是...  我是说...  我没...
No, I just meant... I-I never got, like...

182
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,200
就是细菌感染之类的...  总之...
I just had a bunch of bacterial infect-- you know what?

183
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,500
重点是  你想做善事
The point is, you want to make a difference?

184
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,100
就亲身去实践
Go out on the front line, right?

185
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,490
用链子把自己锁在红杉木上  自焚都行
Chain yourself to a redwood, light yourself on fire.

186
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,140
别今晚就行  懂了吗
Just not tonight, understood?

187
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,050
不好意思  我没在听
I'm sorry, were you saying something?

188
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,050
你那个高低眉太搞笑  让我分心了
I was distracted by how uneven your eyebrows are.

189
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,330
我叫的车来了  我要走了
My Uber's here, so I'm out.

190
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,130
-我想回来自然会回来  -好
- I'll be home whenever. - Cool.

191
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,510
你喝什么呢
What are you drinking?

192
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,010
苦艾酒
Just some absinthe.

193
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,720
你想来点吗
Want to take a ride?

194
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
说真的吗
Seriously?

195
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,510
你又不开车
You're not driving.

196
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,880
行  那就来吧
Sure, what the hell?

197
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,790
好
Okay.

198
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,680
棒
Yes!

199
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,820
听我说
Listen.

200
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,600
我觉得我们俩开始有点误会
I feel like we got off on the wrong foot,

201
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,510
我知道现在这种情况  你不好受
and I know that you're going through a lot right now,

202
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,680
-你父母...  -我没放在心上
- with your parents and... - I don't care about that.

203
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,350
好吧...
Okay, well,

204
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,790
-不管你在不在乎  -不在乎
- whether you do or you don't... - I don't.

205
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,780
好吧  重点是
All right, well, the point is,

206
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,790
我是你小姨  我想当受欢迎的小姨
I'm your aunt and I want to be the cool aunt.

207
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,090
比如你有男生方面的烦恼会来找我
I want you to come to me with boy problems.

208
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,770
或者女生烦恼  不清楚你的性取向
Or girl problems. I don't assume.

209
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,500
怎么样
What do you say?

210
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,180
我们能重新来过吗  拜托
Can we start over? Please?

211
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,780
行  好吧
Yeah, okay. Why not?

212
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,590
我很高兴咱俩能好好说说话  
I just, like, I'm really happy that we're talking,

213
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,390
就是感觉...
and, I don't know, I just feel like...

214
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,970
我有话想跟你说
there is something that I wanted to say to you.

215
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,660
说吧  你可以畅所欲言
Yes, anything, please.

216
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,860
我知道你自以为很聪明
I know you think you're pretty clever

217
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,380
打着小算盘  想把我灌醉
with this little plan to drink me under the table.

218
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,700
但有两个问题
But you see, there are two problems.

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,020
你不聪明
You're not.

220
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,470
你也灌不醉本姑娘
And you can't.

221
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,130
我走了  麦肯齐
Peace out, Mackenzie.

222
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,930
你怎么了啊
Something the matter?

223
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,520
我没事  就是突然感觉有点怪
No, I'm good, I just felt kind of funny for a second.

224
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,310
不是吧  怎么怪了
Man. Funny how?

225
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,260
你是说像吃了
Funny like you just drank

226
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,900
六种安眠药那种感觉吗
six different types of sleep medication funny?

227
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,430
什么
What?

228
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,290
你被我下套了  小妞儿
You got straight played, homie.

229
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,060
不  你也喝了  我...
No, but you took it, too.

230
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,020
你就别瞎操心我了  我千杯不醉
I... I don't want you to worry about me. I can handle my 'Quil.

231
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,110
你...  为什么这么做
Why'd you do that?

232
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,280
因为你逃不出我的五指山呗
Because I own you.

233
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,320
-什么  -晚安了  「小公举」  我送你入寝
- What? - Night-night, princess. Let's get you into your jams.

234
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,740
-不要  -来吧
- No. - Come on, I got you.

235
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,050
等下  不是吧  等下
No, wait! Wait. Hold on.

236
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,300
钥匙  艾尔巴
Keys. Alba.

237
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,700
给我车钥匙  孩子们要迟到了
I need some car keys, the kids are late.

238
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,370
他们已经上学了
The kids go to school already.

239
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,930
普多夫人平时会睡过头
Ms. Poodle likes to sleep in, too,

240
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,960
都是我来搞定
so I took care of it.

241
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,830
真简单
That was easy.

242
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,500
你想让我给你做早餐吗
You want me to make you breakfast?

243
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,830
你想要做  我也不拦你啊
Well, I mean, I don't want you to not make me breakfast.

244
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,910
好吧  那个泳池  水能加热吗
All right, so what's the deal with that pool? Is it heated?

245
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,340
我不知道  我没试过
I don't know. I never tried.

246
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,060
你每天为这个家尽心尽力
You're telling me you're here every single day busting your hump,

247
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,530
这些自命不凡的有钱佬都没让你享受下泳池吗
these entitled monkeys don't even let you get wet?

248
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,700
-我不会游泳  -这不是重点
- I cannot swim. - That's not the point.

249
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,010
泳池就是个比喻
The pool's a metaphor.

250
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,460
这样太不厚道了  这样不对
No, you're getting boxed out, and I don't like that.

251
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,590
这样吧
I'll tell you what,

252
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,750
只要我在这儿  咱俩就平起平坐
as long as I'm here, you and me, we're equals.

253
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,370
-可以吗  -当然了
- Yeah? - Yeah, in fact...

254
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,310
来吧  拉张椅子  我们一起吃早饭
pull up a chair, we're eating breakfast together.

255
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,340
可以吗
Really?

256
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,980
好吧
Okay.

257
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,560
等下  等下
Wait, wait, wait.

258
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,970
你得先做早饭啊
I mean... you got to cook the food first.

259
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,060
做完饭之后  就不分主仆
But after that, equals.

260
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,120
-这件应该很有意思  -好
- Yeah, that one'll be fun. - Okay.

261
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,470
还有鞋
Here come the shoes.

262
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,330
靠近点  我碰不到  信我
Come closer, I can't reach it. Trust me.

263
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,960
-不  -别这样
- No! - Come on!

264
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,770
天呐  太扫兴啦
Man. You are a bummer.

265
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,820
-接球  -我不想
- Catch it! - What? I don't want it.

266
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,540
她怎么了
What's the matter with her?

267
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,150
我觉得她死了
I think she's dead.

268
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,350
她没死  还喘着气呢
She's not dead, I can see her breathing.

269
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,820
你们放学啦
You guys are home.

270
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,110
不错
Cool.

271
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,100
晚上想吃什么
What's everybody thinking for dinner?

272
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,100
我们刚吃完早饭呀
We just ate breakfast.

273
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,470
我们昨天放学后回来  就见你躺在这儿了
You were like this when we came home from school yesterday.

274
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,280
艾尔巴呢
Well, where's Alba?

275
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,260
救命啊
Help!

276
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,060
救我啊
Somebody!

277
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,190
好吧...  早上好
All right, well... good morning.

278
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,650
你头上戴了个什么玩意儿
What's that crap on your head?

279
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,350
猫头鹰  是我们的吉祥物
An owl, it's our mascot.

280
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,620
我们今天要见到一只活的了
We're unveiling a live one today at assembly.

281
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,770
肯定好玩极了  
It's gonna be awesome.

282
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,700
根本不是  而是很变态
It's not gonna be awesome, it's sick.

283
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,980
猫头鹰会困在笼子里
He's gonna be trapped in a cage

284
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,660
一群讨厌的蠢孩子会戳他  喂他吃软糖
while a bunch of morons poke him and feed him gummy bears.

285
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,100
这张专辑太逊了  「破歌」真难听
Change the record. This song sucks.

286
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,610
要是有人
How would you feel

287
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,930
把你拉走强制关到笼子里呢
if someone ripped you off your barstool and threw you in a cage?

288
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,830
我被关的次数
I cannot count the number of times

289
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,160
都多到数不清了
I've been ripped off a barstool and thrown in a cage.

290
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,560
故事「感人」
Cool story.

291
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,850
我们要走了  
We're gonna head out, okay?

292
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,450
跟新郎问好吧
Give my regards to the groom.

293
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,600
不如我送你们去学校吧
How about I drive you guys?

294
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,370
我还是离开这里吧
Should probably get out of the house.

295
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,200
昨天有点玩过头了
Yesterday kind of got away from me.

296
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,790
可恶  该死...  好了
Get in there, you bastard. Let's do it.

297
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,840
好  我们到了
There. Here we are.

298
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,420
再见  塞布丽娜  今天过得愉快哦  
Bye, Sabrina. Have a great day.

299
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,050
我爱你  小姨爱你哦
I love you. Auntie loves you all day long.

300
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,040
早  奇普
Morning, Chip.

301
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,220
早  小黛
Hey, Steffi.

302
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,720
-最近好吗...  -你好啊  「小奇普」
- How's it going? - 'Sup, Chippy?

303
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,560
父母坐牢坐得舒服吗
How are your folks liking the clink?

304
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,640
混蛋奇诺·皮尼罗
Freaking Geno Pinero!

305
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,800
我讨厌死他了
I hate that guy.

306
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,940
那你就反抗啊 
Yeah. Well, do something about it.

307
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,790
怎么反抗
Like what?

308
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,400
那家伙就是个神经病
The guy is a maniac.

309
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,650
他把水管捅进丹尼的屁股
He stuck a garden hose up Danny Clerkin's butt

310
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,540
水从鼻子涌出来了
and the water shot out of his nose!

311
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,890
好吧  那不是真的
Okay. Well, that didn't happen,

312
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,170
但还有这样的传闻  挺有意思
but I am delighted that the rumor exists.

313
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,400
小子  下次他再欺负你
Look, pal, next time he gives you crap,

314
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,380
你就拽下他的裤子
yank his pants down

315
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,030
嘲笑他的鸡鸡小
and point at his tiny pecker.

316
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,890
-那样就行了  -你也不正常
- That'll do it. - You're insane, okay?

317
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,430
他会揍死我
He-He'll pound me.

318
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,710
不会  「搞笑」分分钟虐死「暴力」
No! Humor trumps violence.

319
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,540
信我  女生喜欢风趣搞笑的男生
Trust me, girls want the funny guy.

320
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,150
麦肯齐
Mackenzie.

321
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,350
我就感觉像你
I thought that was you.

322
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,960
我叫利兹  你姐的朋友
Liz, Poodle's friend.

323
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,610
孩子带得怎么样啊
How are you managing with the kids?

324
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,920
塞布丽娜有些难搞哦
Sabrina can be a bit of a handful.

325
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,130
塞布丽娜吗  她可帮忙了
Sabrina? No, she's been very helpful.

326
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,910
没有她  我都不知道该怎么办
I don't know how I'd manage without her.

327
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,990
我得走了
Well, I got to run.

328
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,460
你该休息一下  你看上去筋疲力尽
Make sure you get some sleep, you look tired.

329
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,470
-再见哦  亲  -再见  亲
- Bye, hon. - Bye, hon.

330
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,450
只有周二才能够应付那种婊气的女人啊
That woman is a real see you next Tuesday.

331
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,410
周二怎么了
What happens on Tuesday?

332
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,870
墨西哥卷饼  两元特惠酒饮
Tacos. Two-dollar drink specials.

333
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,050
你怎么还不去上课
What are you still doing there?

334
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,030
我想念爸爸和妈妈
I miss Mommy and Daddy.

335
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,460
好吧  这样吧  小家伙
Well... I'll tell you what, kid.

336
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,910
坐到前面吧
Why don't you pop on up front?

337
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,430
你今天翘课吧  来吧
You are playing hooky today. Come on.

338
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,440
但如果我错过了重要课程内容呢
But what if I miss something important?

339
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,740
能错过什么  
Like what?

340
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,530
怎么把鼻屎磋没吗
How to roll your boogers between your fingers till they disappear?

341
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,090
坐稳了
Buckle up.

342
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,560
宿醉太难受了
I am hungover.

343
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,740
什么是宿醉
What's hungover?

344
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,670
就是...  
Well, you know, it's, like...

345
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,690
比如你吃了很多糖果
you know when you eat a whole bunch of candy?

346
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,160
很多甜食  吃的时候感觉很美好
Sweet stuff, and at the time it feels great,

347
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,660
但第二天会肚子痛
but then the next day you got, like, a tummy ache?

348
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,400
这就是「宿醉」的感觉
That's hungover.

349
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,770
你试过上大号吗
Have you tried pooping?

350
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,200
有时候拉完  就好受了
Sometimes that makes my tummy feel better.

351
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,340
我没有
I have not. But I will definitely

352
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,380
但我会考虑一下这么做  谢谢
take that into consideration. Thank you.

353
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,090
本  你饿吗  
Ben, you hungry?

354
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,000
想吃冰淇淋吗
You, feeling like having some ice cream?

355
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,130
我不能吃  我妈说我对冰淇淋过敏
I can't. My mom says I'm allergic.

356
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,180
我告诉你实话吧
Yeah, well, I got news for you, pal.

357
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,290
你妈就是把她的饮食失调症加之于你了
Your mom is just projecting her own eating disorders onto you.

358
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,390
什么是「加之于你」
What's projecting?

359
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,980
问得好  意思就是...
Great question. Projecting, that's, like,

360
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,830
明明是自己的问题
when something's wrong with you,

361
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,200
-你却觉得别人有问题  -起火了
- but you think something's wrong with somebody else. - Fire!

362
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,830
-怎么了  怎么了  -救火啊
- What? What? Fire! - Help!

363
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,260
是啊  起火了  快灭火
Yeah. Somebody get that.

364
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,980
来吧  小家伙  吃吧
Here you go, buddy, dig in.

365
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,670
为什么不花钱买呢
Why didn't we pay for it?

366
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,230
我没钱呗
I don't have any money.

367
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,600
为什么呢
Why not?

368
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,520
-有些人就比别人穷呗  -为什么呢
- Some people have less money than others. - Why?

369
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,800
小家伙  我不会花一整天时间
Look, pal. I'm not gonna just stop the whole day and explain

370
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,050
跟你解释经济收入这回事
the ins and outs of the economy to you, all right, now?

371
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,580
因为很没劲...  懂吗
'Cause it's boring, okay?

372
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,980
还因为我其实也不是很懂
And also 'cause I don't totally have a firm grasp on it myself.

373
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,210
我可以给你买呀
Well, I would have paid for you.

374
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,860
你真是「暖男」
You are so sweet.

375
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,030
不如我来背你...  那是...
Now, don't you go breaking your piggy bank open.

376
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,550
那是运通黑卡吗
Is that... is that a Black Card?

377
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,010
塞布丽娜
Sabrina?

378
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,830
你好啊
What's up?

379
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,910
你怎么把这破鸟弄到家里来了
What is that gross bird doing in this house?

380
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,780
我从学校偷回来的
I stole him from school.

381
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,060
我实在不忍心看鸟儿这样被对待
I just couldn't watch him be treated like that anymore, you know?

382
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,790
是啊  这鸟在这里跟你那些蠢朋友
Yes. Yes. I'm sure he's much happier here

383
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,520
一起听着破曲  肯定快活多了
listening to thumping techno with your moron friends.

384
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,330
-管好你这只鸟  -别激动
- Control your animal! - Relax.

385
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,110
我要将这只猫头鹰送到野生保护地放生
I'm gonna liberate him in a wildlife preserve near Stratford.

386
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,260
你脑子进水了啊
Are you insane?

387
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,490
被人抓到之前  赶紧还回学校
Take him back to school right this second, before you get busted.

388
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,370
这下好了
Great!

389
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,570
你又怎么了
What happened to you?

390
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,710
我告诉你怎么了
I'll tell you what happened.

391
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,530
我想用「搞笑」虐死「暴力」
I tried to trump violence with humor,

392
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,660
结果我被「暴力」虐惨了
and violence won by a landslide.

393
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,330
显然你做得不对啊
Well, clearly you didn't do it right.

394
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,820
你有嘲笑他的鸡鸡小吗
Did you remember to laugh at his tiny penis?

395
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,930
这部分才是亮点
That part's pretty important.

396
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,960
超级大  没被他的「大雕」打就不错了
It was humongous! I'm lucky he didn't beat me with it.

397
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,630
你去处理一下脸上的伤吧
Okay. I... uh, go put a steak on your face or something, I don't know.

398
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,490
塞布丽娜  你能用下脑子吗
Sabrina, can you please try and think for a second?

399
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,610
是你教我  做善事就要亲身去实践
You're the one who told me to get out on the front lines.

400
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,460
我教的都是馊招  大家都知道
Well, I don't... I give terrible advice! Everybody knows that.

401
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,740
看看我多惨啊
Look at me! I'm grotesque.

402
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,890
-我要告死他  -什么罪名
- I'm gonna sue his ass. - For what?

403
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,260
殴打
Battery.

404
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,160
然后我要告学校失职  
And then I'm going to sue the school for negligence.

405
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,990
得了吧
Okay. Pipe down, all right?

406
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,910
告死别人  也俘获不了那女孩的芳心
You're not gonna sue your way into this girl's pants.

407
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,710
是吗  那你就瞧着吧
Yeah? Watch me!

408
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,160
又怎么了
Now what?

409
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,060
你有什么事啊
What do you want?

410
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,040
就是过来看看
Just checking in.

411
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,500
我感觉你不会做饭
You don't strike me as much of a cook,

412
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,140
所以我做了点炖锅菜给你
so I brought you a casserole.

413
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,550
你真是个大好人啊
You are so, so sweet.

414
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,840
糟糕了...
Shoot.

415
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,660
你是故意的
You did that on purpose.

416
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,010
天呐...  你把他怎么了
My, what did you do to him?

417
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,000
不是我打的
No. I didn't do that.

418
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,430
他在学校看同学的小鸡鸡  被揍了
He got pounded at school for checking out some kid's wiener.

419
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,620
都是拜你所赐
Because of you!

420
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,280
现在小黛觉得我就是怂货
Now Steffi thinks I'm a joke

421
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,680
学校里的人都知道奇诺有个「大雕」了
and Geno's got the raddest freaking dong in school.

422
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,020
米琪小姨  能再给我点冰淇淋吗
Mickey, can I have some more ice cream?

423
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,540
忍不了了  我要报警
That's it. I'm calling the cops.

424
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,960
回你自己家报警吧
Why don't you call the cops from your house?

425
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,150
你别碰我  
Get your hands off me.

426
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,720
我还没使劲呢
Lady, I haven't even begun to put hands on you.

427
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,980
两位女士  下午好
Afternoon, ladies.

428
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,670
-又是你  -一切都好吧
- You again. - Is everything okay?

429
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,650
警官  这个女人对我动粗了
Officer, this woman assaulted me.

430
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,100
第一  这种指控太荒唐
Number one, that is ludicrous.

431
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,030
第二  这人根本算不上警察
Number two, this man is an officer of nothing.

432
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,120
-孩子们跟她在一起不安全  -孩子们很好
- She's a danger to these children. - The kids are fine.

433
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,750
他们看起来可不好啊
They do not look fine.

434
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,200
-你俩都滚出我家  -这不是你家
You know what? Why don't you both get out of my house? It's not your house.

435
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,250
-你有身份证明吗  -给你看  做梦吧
- Can I see some identification? - I'm not showing you dick.

436
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,000
塞布丽娜  你别走  我还没跟你谈完
Sabrina? Don't you go anywhere. I am not done talking to you.

437
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,640
-你住在这里吗  -是的
- Do you live here? - Yeah.

438
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,830
这个人是谁
Who is this?

439
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,880
不认识
No idea.

440
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,020
女士  请你出来  我们查明一下
Okay, ma'am. Why don't we step outside until we figure this out?

441
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,600
你都不是个真警察  戴个假警章吓唬谁啊
You are not even a real cop. You've got a cloth badge.

442
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,620
别逼我动手
Don't make me detain you.

443
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,870
怎么制服我啊  你都没有枪
With what? You have no gun.

444
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,180
是  但我有电击枪
No, I have a Taser.

445
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,300
小贱人  希望你带了两把
Bitch, I hope you brought two,

446
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,670
电击对姐来说  就跟过家家似的
'cause Mama's got a real high tolerance.

447
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,200
好吧  你逼我的
Okay. Here we go.

448
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,830
天呐  不
No!

449
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,630
我的天呐  太抱歉了
My God, I'm so sorry!

450
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,430
-你没事吧  -看着不像没事
- Are you okay? - I doubt it.

451
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,100
这都是你的错  我要找真警察了
This is all your fault. I'm calling the real police for this...

452
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,050
艾尔巴  你来真格的啊
Alba! Are you serious?

453
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,750
太给力了
That was unbelievable.

454
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,360
我不喜欢这些人  但我喜欢你
I don't like these people, but I like you.

455
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,700
你去阻止塞布丽娜吧
So, go stop Sabrina,

456
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,190
别担心  我会「料理」好他们
and don't worry, I will clean this up.

457
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,970
好  好
Y-Yeah. Yeah.

458
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,490
多嘴问一下  你说「料理」是指...
Just to be clear, when you say clean it up...?

459
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,020
我把他们安全送回家
I take 'em home, make sure they're okay.

460
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,610
好  这就好  谢谢
Okay. Good, good, good. Thank you!

461
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,650
塞布丽娜  是我
Sabrina, it's me!

462
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,890
你给我听着  你不能偷猫头鹰
Listen to me, you can't just steal owls.

463
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,340
如果你将其放生
If you free this owl,

464
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,600
我就再找一只弄死  「以牙还牙」
I will murder another one, just to even the score.

465
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,590
你可听好了
So, know that!

466
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,070
听到留言  就给我回电
This is an insane message. Call me back.

467
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,790
塞布丽娜  你在哪儿
Sabrina, where are you?!

468
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,390
塞布丽娜  你没事吧
Sabrina, are you okay?

469
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,370
我没事啊  我在索霍区的阁楼派对上呢
Yeah, I'm cool. I'm at this loft party in SoHo.

470
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,510
我没事
It's all right.

471
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,900
那我来野生动物保护区干什么
Then what am I doing at the wildlife preserve?

472
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,450
打开后备箱
Pop the trunk.

473
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,700
不  本  把火柴给我
No, Ben. Give me the matches.

474
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,420
别乱翻我包  好吗
Please stay out of my purse, okay?

475
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,720
-喂  -妹妹  是我
- Hello. - Hey, sis, it's me.

476
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,880
你跑哪去了
Where the hell are you?

477
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,860
我们不得不逃出境了
We had to flee the country.

478
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,690
啥
What?

479
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,540
你不是说只是一场误会吗
I thought you said it was a misunderstanding.

480
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,300
本来是  就是
It was. It is.

481
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,170
-那...  -这事很复杂  听着
- Well... - It's complicated. Listen.

482
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,000
你得帮我多照顾一段时间孩子们了
I need you to watch the kids a little longer.

483
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,070
不行  不行  不行  
No. No. Nope.

484
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,610
我才不要  我已经「坐过牢」了 
No, I'm not gonna do that. I already did my time.

485
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,750
不行  我不答应
No, my answer's no.

486

-抱歉  手机信号不好...  -才不是
- Sorry, Mick, no, yeah, you-you're breaking up. - No...

487
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,470
-我听不清...   -不不不  别给我整这套
- I can't hear you. - No, no, no. I know what you're doing.

488
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,150
别装了  我听得清  得了吧  不行  普多
Stop it. I can hear you just fine. No, Poodle.

-听不清了...  -你挂我电话试试
- Can't hear you, hanging up, gotta go. - Don't you hang up the phone.

492
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,120
喂  喂
Hello? Hello?

493
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,240
你没事吧
You okay?

494
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,660
你看起来不怎么样啊
You don't look so hot.

495
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,210
你一直都是一副衰相  但...
I mean, you never look great, but

496
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,460
你现在的样子更衰
right now you look, like, actively bad.

497
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,610
我没事  塞布丽娜  多谢关心
No. I'm fine, Sabrina. Thank you for your concern.

- How are you? - I'm awesome.

499

这鸡肉真好吃
This chicken is fantastic.

500
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,720
亲爱的  那可不是鸡肉
Sweetheart. That's not chicken.
